<h3 class="ph3">MOOCS</h3>

<p>This document is for potential clients, recruiters, and potential employers.</p> 
<p>It lists some of the key courses I've taken and skills I've learned over 10,000 hours of study, practice, and research during the last 12 years.</p>
<p>In some cases, I've been paid to learn new skills, and in other cases, I've used my own time.</p> 
<p>Whoever you are, however, if you've poked your nose around here, you have now the opportunity to see the names of some of the courses I've taken and PDFs I've obtained as references. In almost every case, I've had to research which material to use. In some cases, I had some luck finding the material easily, in other cases not so much. </p>

<h3 class="ph3">Ranking Efforts</h3>

<p>I found study method has a big impact on retention. For example, revisiting material later with note cards improves retention.</p>

<p>I ranked listed materials out of 5 to indicate how thoroughly I studied them.</p> 

<p>[<span class="num">5/5</span>] means I watched all the videos and did all the exercises.</p>

<p>[<span class="num">3/5</span>] to [<span class="num">5/5</span>] means I watched all the videos and did between 0% and %100 of the exericises.</p>

<p>[<span class="num">3/5</span>] and under, means I did not watch all of the videos or do all of the exercises.</p>

<p>[<span class="inc">Incomplete</span>] means I want to one day finish the course.</p>

<p>[Multi] means a mixture of various course materials, PDFs, code samplings, and other methods were used.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2023]</span> API Design in NODE V4 [<span class="nam">Scott Moss</span>]&nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>Scott's courses are thorough, and hands on. In this course, he walks us through Node backend server code through primarily express.js (the parent of next.js). He builds out a standard event driven request/response architecture, with a lot attention given to middleware.</p>
<p>He shows how to build out a data-base using an object-relational mapping approach (ORM SDK) with Prisma. By walking through the schema design, he demonstrates the kind of decisions that might go into ORM data architectures. </p> 
<p>Code is written in Typescript, because of the completion it offers, but typing is still static. There are some nifty demonstrations of npm libraries in action, like npx, @prisma/client, morgan, cors, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, dotenv, jest, supertest, and ts-node.</p>
<p>There's some good discussion around REST/CRUD, GRPC, as well as authentication, using token validation, error handling, testing (integration/unit), and deployment.</p>
<p>Scott tests his API with VSCode ThunderClient plugin, which is quicker and simpler than setting up Postman. That's a good example of when to use VSCode, if you're a long-time Emacs user, and wouldn't normally reach for it.</p>

<div>

<ul>
<li>Object oriented</li>
<li>Uses YouTube API</li>
<li>Supports multiple Youtube players from front-matter json file entries</li>
<li>Error Handling. API updates on YouTube's side, came with some kind of network throttling. Presumably, the stability of their previous system can be regained with some kind of paid subscription. I handled the errors with temporary error handling code. The code refreshes the player when any particular song fails to load. After a set number of subsequent failures, the page refreshes. </li>

<p>YouTube's free API is not as creamy as it once was, but it's still revolutionary from the user side, in that equilibrium price of high-quality music is lower than ever before. How good a thing is that in the long-run, one cannot say. The equilibrium price of many activities and their products is at all-time historical lows while corporate profits are at all time historical highs, indexed for population increases. The professional study of such phenomenon however is no longer in my wheelhouse. It is therefore not my position to comment on it.</p>

<h4><span class="year">[2022]</span> General</h4>

<ul>
<li>A busy year with plenty of progress </li>
<li>Learned to write HTML newsletters and built an HTML newsletter generator in HUGO </li>
<li>Built and integrated the linux based email client mu and the emacs library mu4e to work with windows </li>
<li>Compiling emacs from source</li>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2022]</span> Script Formatting &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>Learned about script writing, and explored several scripts. For example: "The Matrix", "Princess Bride", "There Will Be Blood", "Batman Begins", "Good Will Hunting", "The Usual Suspects", and "The Fifth Element".</p>  

<p>Set up a custom template with LaTex, from a library built for that purpose. Then chose to export the script directly from Emacs into HTML and convert from HTML to PDF.</p> 
<p>The process required using an Emacs macro, which despite the fact that the 'macs' in 'Emacs' is short for 'macro', doesn't happen that often. Still, there was a lot of fast copy paste, which I call 'Bank, Chop, Slap'.</p>
<p>Hence the final result: <a href="https://buildhello.ca/bcs/payback/payback_monospace.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pay Back - Monospace, by Bang/Chop/Slap Editing</a></p>

<div>

<p>In my case, what they say was true, "you never really know a language until you teach it."</p>
<p>The course writing gig was an opportunity to dial JavaScript and I took it.</p>  
<p>Covering JavaScript to the level of detail necessary to write a course in it, opened my eyes to many programming concepts I had read about before but did not entirely understand.</p>
<p>Where functional programming fits in, for example. The basics building blocks of any language, from naming conventions, syntax, and data types, to operators, conditional expressions, APIs, loops, functions, and more. 
In the JavaScript case, there is so much more, from getters and setters, to maps and iterators, prototypal inheritance, asynchrony, constructors, concurrancy and standard built-in objects. JavaScript has become quite an advanced language. Learning it to a higher-level opened up my eyes to many of the things I had learned already but didn't fully understand.</p>

<p>Refactoring websites to use org-mode file generators. Emacs org-mode allows you to generating multiple files from a single collapsible document. That works wonders for organizing, accessing, editing, and updating code. If you want to try something new, you don't need to rely on git, you can just copy the collapsed file block, comment out the old one and make any changes you want. To revert, just comment out the new block and comment-in the old one. It's a much more intelligent system and makes working on any project much much easier. Learning the system took more time than implementing it.</p>

<div>

<p>In 2019, I built my own Emacs software from source code in WSl. In 2021, I built it again, this time using the MSYS2 Unix system.</p>
<p>I had not documented the WSl parts of the build carefully enough and just happend to find a blog post with an MSYS2 build instructions.</p>
<p>In fact, after building Emacs 29 on Windows following the MSYS2 instructions, I blogged about it, which you can read here: <a href="https://readingworldmagazine.com/emacs/2022-02-24-compiling-emacs-29-from-source-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://readingworldmagazine.com/emacs/2022-02-24-compiling-emacs-29-from-source-on-windows/</a></p>
<p>The build required learning a fair amount about MSYS2, which I have used since to build other linux software for windows (like `mu`, for example), because there is sometimes source code available in the MSYS package repository.</p>

<li>Take apart Pancakes theme: learn to implement custom partials from front-matter blocks</li>
<li>Continue exploration of npm libraries [minification, css watch, sass compilation, build pipelines]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you can implement custom partials from front-matter blocks, you can automate module selection from front-matter parameters, like tags, categories, or custom taxonomies. I got that idea from the pancakes theme, but didn't get to write the code until 2023. If the website has say 20,000 product pages, each page can access different advertising modules based on taxonomies. Of course, AI will manage advertisement selection for online stores, but for small business AI costs money.</p>

<div>

<p>Configured to a very basic level both Atom and VSCode. The idea here was that a tooling set-up that is only Emacs limits your ability to communicate with other developers. Given the Emacs development culture, which is based primarily on happenstance, there will also be some tools that are currently only available in over-the-counter editors.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Atom, the JavaScript based editor created by Facebook, became obsolete. But VSCODE is going very strong, and in some case, for example API in testing in Thunderclient vs Postman, it just make sense to use VSCODE.</p>

<div>

<p>Installed Linux on an free (Airmiles) HP Laptop, 1.4 GHz AMD E1 Dual Core, with 4GB Ram. It came with Windows preinstalled with maximum bloat. HP typically come with integrated motherboards, and no extra slots, so using it while I overhauled my other system was a matter of installing a low memory Linux operating system.</p>
<p>Mint is not exactly the lowest memory Linux system, but I found it similar to Windows and the HP took it well. It still hums along nicely, which is amazing.  Like most of us, I no longer remember the things we could do with a 1.4GHz processor when Y2K was a problem.</p>
<p>Everything Unix up to that point was done on Cygwin. It was great to build out a working Mint installation.</p>
<p>The Mint system backup also enabled an upgrade of the main computer, and led to the customization of a proper Emacs configuration for Linux systems.</p>

<ul>
<li>Selected and installed distribution Mint</li>
<li>Learned Ubuntu package manager, installation customizations</li>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2019]</span> Build Hello  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>In 2019 I started building simultaneously both back and front-ends for Cloud Nine, which would become eventually readingworldmagazine.com, and buildhello.ca, with HUGO</p>
<p>Building the two sites simultaneously was not planned. I was just experimenting with two themes at the same time while figuring out Hugo. Whenever I learned and implemented new code on one site, I wanted to know how to implement it on the other. Then I'd work on that one until I figured something new out, and then switch again. </p>
<p>That process led to the notion of Cloud Nine being a personal blog and Build Hello being a small business website.</p>
<p>Build Hello however, was the priority, and I put a lot of attention into it. For example, I put together a list of some 100 or so names, and started checking their availabilty. The words build and hello came up in a number of places, but not together. When I finally put them together, I had them the other way around, but that URL was taken: see hellobuild.com, it's super cool! I flipped the words around and liked it so much I bought it with the '.ca' extension.</p>
<p>In 2019, I also designed around 50 Build Hello logos, before narrowing them down to the current one. I also designed the sample site PDF, on the front page.</p>
<p>The Build Hello build in 2019 was a single page that used jQuery, had tabbed divs, externally loaded font-awesome icons, and some very basic animations. </p>
<p>I started the build from the infrastructure of a theme (which sadly I no longer recall). That infrastructure got me researching CSS specificity and CSS resets, as well as using animations and icons. </p>

<h4><span class="year">[2019]</span> Learning HUGO</h4>
<p>Learning Hugo was not so easy. There were no courses or books available at the time, so everything had to figured out from trial and error, reading community comments, and browsing blog posts. </p>
<p>The documentation was confusing to read, but easier when I copy pasted the individual pages into an org-file and changed the theme. The problem was a combination of layout, font-selection, and content gaps. Changing up the layout and fonts made it easier to understand.</p>
<p>If I were to learn Hugo again, I'd work first through Regis Philbert's posts from the new dynamic and his personal blog. Those tutorials cover some of the material that is less well explained in the documentation. I'd also work first on getting the context variable '.', which is for passing and referencing scope. </p>
<p>There are also many small bits of knowledge that seem difficult to come by, like for example how white space works from the 'liquidish' templating Hugo uses. Btw, it works like this: a dash on the inside of the double braces used to insert Hugo code into HTML removes all the white space after render. Two consecutive chunks of Hugo code inserted into HTML and containing HTML will have no end-of-line between them if written like this:  `{{- $hugoCode -}}{{- $hugoCode -}}`. If, on the other hand, they are written like this: `{{- $hugoCode }}{{ $hugoCode -}}` with the second block on a newline, when they render to HTML each block will be on its own line.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of little things in Hugo that need to be explained or researched. I highly recommend taking a Hugo course if you can find one, and if you cannot, hiring a consultant to walk you through how Hugo works.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2019]</span> Google's Go Programming Language  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>I became interested in Go because of Hugo. Once I had read a paper stating that it was built to purpose with garbage collection that freed up unused memory from memory blocks that in C++ remained dedicated to the process they were associated with, I wanted to explore only just a little bit further.
I expect the terminology I've used to explain that is not perfect, but the point is that Go was created to be a 'more' efficient language.</p> 

<p>I found Todd McLeod's course, and set into it for a few days to a week. The work was easy to follow and well-presented; however, as I knew I would I dropped it. My goal was to gain proficiency in web development. Learning Go was unecessary.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2019]</span> Cloud Nine  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>Cloud Nine, 'cloudnine.github.io', today known as 'readingworldmagazine.com,' was built from the Hugo Silhouette theme (created by Matt Button), alongside Build Hello.</p>
<p>If you navigate to readingworldmagazine.com and click on the '+', under the hero image, which brings up the old version of the Cloud Nine design, you can still see similarities with the Silhouette theme, but everything under the hood has rebuilt. All that remains today from Silhouette is the color of the navigation and footer.</p>
<p>The project would eventually feature youtube players and search functionality, but in 2019 it was just about getting old material online.</p>
<p>Eventually, when Cloud Nine became Reading World Magazine, my personal page was moved here (https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/).</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2019]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>Continued in 2019 learning the Emacs functionality listed below. My configuration at the time was based on HELM minibuffer functionality, which offered short-cut keys to follow various command chains from buffer selections. I had been using Helm since 2016/2017ish and coincidentally moved to the 'counsel'/'ivy' combination in 2020, the same year Helm maintainence stopped.</p>  

<p>For system navigation (what 'explorer' is for in Windows), I used projectile-mode instead of standard bookmarks with search functionality, which is what I use in 2023.</p> 

<p>In 2019, I covered a lot of Emacs ground, which would set the stage for building out a new configuration in 2020. Load time in 2019 was more than a minute. In 2020, load time was brought down to under a few seconds (today it's '310 packages loaded in 0.265646 seconds').</p>

<p>More important than load time, of course, are your editor use-cases. What do you use it for and how does it help you achieve those objectives. That comes down to your workflow and your package selection. </p>

<p>Here's a list of some of the functionality I was using in 2019, which was mostly package based, and would make up a decent part of the custom Emacs build I completed from 2020 to 2022:</p>


<ul>

<li>scheduling</li>
<li>hydra's</li>
<li>elnode</li>
<li>web-mode</li>
<li>emmet-mode</li>
<li>yasnippet</li>
<li>php-mode</li>
<li>easy-hugo</li>
<li>auto-complete</li>
<li>rudimentary company mode</li>
<li>minimal org-mode</li>
<li>smart-parens</li>
<li>skeleton-pairs</li>
<li>olivetti mode</li>    
<li>clipboard to kill-ring</li>
<li>hungry-delete</li>
<li>command-log mode</li>
<li>expand-region</li>
<li>easy-kill</li>
<li>anki</li>
<li>pandoc</li>
<li>docview</li>
<li>markdown mode</li>
<li>elnode</li>
<li>shell-wrappers (commint)</li>
<li>custom default shell switcher</li>
</ul>

<p>Todo scheduling (time scheduling) is something that came out of reading the Emacs manual. It gives the ability to keep a schedule from within emacs and receive reminders through your phone (orgzly app) and your emacs calendar. There is also task clocking functionality, which you can use to track the effor you put into projects against your targeted effort. Frankly put, I don't use scheduling and clocking that much in emacs, but it can be really helpful when you need it. The phone integration, is tremendously useful and easy to use for everything from appointments to shopping lists. It's almost as useful as a white board and a stack of post-it notes. </p>
<p>I won't go on and explain the packages (I currently have installed more than 300), but from the list above the hyra's, org-mode, company-mode, anki, and emmet mode have turned out to be really useful.</p>
<p>I didn't really get into using Anki heavily until 2023, but it is a game changer in terms of speeding up your learning curve when tackling complex plentiful material.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2019]</span> React for Absolute Beginners  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>Victor's course was fun and fast. I spent only maybe three or four days on it, and did not look again at React until 2023. It walked me through the very basics, however, which was useful in understanding where React fits into the scheme of things when it comes to web development (reusable JavaScript components that render their own HTML in the DOM on the spot).</p>

<h4><span class="year">[2018]</span> General</h4>

<p>In 2018 I moved back to the city and purchased a new computer. That meant installing hardware, revisiting BIOSes, and reading up on partitioning. </p>
<p>I also picked up where I had left of in 2017 studying and practicing design, mostly through software tutorials explaining 'Gimp' and 'Inkscape'.</p>
<p>I continued as well occasionally with various bits and pieces of the subject matter I had covered in prior years, and then began to explore Hugo the web development templating language built on top of the Go programming language (and to some extent the 'liquid' templating language). </p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2018]</span> Hugo  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>
 

<p>The decision to select Hugo was based on the idea that it would be suitable for generating massive numbers of pages from product data. It was also said to create sites that were free to host, and to integrate nicely with Emacs.</p> 

<p>When I say 'massive numbers of pages from product data,' I was thinking about books. I've always wanted to do something with them. In 2014, I  bought the URL 'knowsbooksclub.com' (which sadly I've never used). </p>

<p>But the problems with online bookstores are obviously many; but the fact that the 'Hugo' in 'Hugo' was meant to be suggestive of 'Victor Hugo', author of 'Les Miserables' was enough for me.</p> 
<p>I got started experimenting with blog themes and put together the blog Cloud Nine in the following year.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2018]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Both 2018 and 2019 were big years in terms of Emacs exploration. Examining other configurations, reading up on their recommendations, and trying out their code would lead to a complete rebuild of my own Emacs 'distro' in 2020.</p> 
<p>I was influenced during both years by some of the following YouTube Emacs presenters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uncle Dave's videos</li>
<li>Mike Zamensky</li>
<li>Howard Abrams - literate programming</li>
<li>John Weigley</li>
<li>Xah lee</li>
<li>Sacha Chua</li> 
<li>Magnar Sveen</li>
<li>Steve Purcell</li>
<li>Others</li>
</ul>

<p>Mike Zamensky's videos were plentiful and decently explanatory, I looked into some of the libraries (more so in 2019/2020). Howard Abram's literate programming was at the time mildly interesting, but would change everything about the way I use Emacs, and also the way in general I code out projects.</p>
<p>I found John Weigley's init because of use-package, and ended up eventually using ledger, as well as following some of his Emacs init (sort-word, string-inflection, tagedit)</p>
<p>Of course if you're exploring Emacs you will find plenty of init code on the web, as well as various emacs posts from the likes of Magnar Sveen, Steve Purcell, Sacha Chua, and Xah Lee, among others.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2018]</span> All Things JavaScript  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<p>There was a reason why I put time into JavaScript in 2018, but it escapes me now. I'm much better at detailing git commit messages in 2023 than I was in even 2022.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, I worked through some of Stephen Hancock's YouTube courses, which as I recall were somewhat confusing to me (that should give you an idea of my level of expertise with JavaScript in 2018).</p>
<p>Having said that, I first learned to modularize code with IIFE statements from Steven Hancock in 2018, which was in fact helpful in later years both conceptualizing ES6 modules and writing course work about them.</p>

<h4><span class="year">[2017]</span> General</h4>

<p>2017 was another year building out foundational knowledge in web development. It's a fast changing field with a wide and varied selection of knowledge sets many of which are also deep. Specialization in one language, CMS, or framework is still the recommended approach, but any technology can become quickly obsolete and exploring the bird's eye view is necessary. One needs to know where the pieces fit to see how changes are relevant, and ultimately what comes next.</p> 
<p>I've found building out a custom computer system complete with its own dev-ops tooling is a means to proficiency, and the more I looked, the more I saw others doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Professors state it is the theory that matters and not the software, and there is truth in that, but in the end, software proficiency is game changing.</p>
<p>While I continued to gain proficiency in Emacs throughout the year, my configuration was still light years away from savvy and snappy. The knowledge base, however, was growing. I began in 2017, for example, to search Emacs related blogs, to gain further insights into mode functionality.</p> 
<p>I also continued with data science studies, writing studies, and added to my understanding of Unix systems, since I had worked primarily with only Windows from 2000.</p>

</div>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2017]</span> Installed and explored Avada and Elementor Themes  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>I spent some time in 2017 with both the Avada and Elementor 'builders'. Avada is a theme with an admin interface, Elementor is a plugin with an admin interface. Today, Elementor is the more popular option, and the one I would recommend, if I wasn't already recommending a less complex WordPress build using the stock Gutenberg editor and the free 'underscores' theme (or in the case that you prefer to pay, the Newspaper theme). </p>

<p>In the modern world of WordPress there are seemingly endless options, all of them with the same problems other CMS face, problems like user experience, load time optimization, design, modularization, maintenance, developer experience, and 5-year developer cost.</p>
<p>That level of choice is a good reason to hire a consultant to walk you through the 'choice' variables and clarify what you need to know from the commercial noise.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2017]</span> Technical Writing Course  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Worked again through more technical writing material. The course listed in the registry above and another one, not listed. In general, covered the topics listed below. I know today that I was trying to figure out what are called Dev-ops, and how they apply to technical writing. How do companies maintain a single source of components that can be pushed out to blogs, magazines, emails, white-papers, websites, and software documentation?</p>

<p>One answer is with components maintained in a centralized versioned repository. That's the answer the Oxygen editor was supposed to provide with 'DITA Maps' and 'Single-Source DITA Publishing.' While I personally am not proficient in the Oxygen Editor (and therefore cannot say if it succeeded tremendously well in achieving that objective), it is not such a challenge to convert with an NPM build script markdown files stored in a centralized git repository into various publication sources, like PDFs, ePubs, and HTML.</p>

<ul>
<li>How to write components that explain how to use software features</li>
<li>How to organize technical writing documentation components</li>
<li>Different types of technical writing</li>
<li>How to maintain technical writing in a repository that can be pushed out by components to a variety of publications [theoretical]</li>
</ul>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2017]</span> Data Science  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>I worked again also on data science in 2017.</p>
<p>This led to revisiting R-programming, exploring R default packages (which I attempted to memorize, not entirely successfully), and touching up my R Emacs configuration.</p>
<p>I put together another video showcasing some of that knowledge: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUOO-oW3ylc&t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUOO-oW3ylc&t=1s</a></p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2017]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>In 2017, my emacs configuration hadn't changed much from 2016. I've added with 'eval-after-load' and 'require' as a rudimentary load-time optimizations scheme. My load time is absolutely terrible. All custom code and packages are loading upfront.</p>
<p>My Emacs instances also has a complicated mix of initialization and custom settings configurations. I didn't know that Emacs stores customizations in their own 'custom' configuration file).</p>
<p>I'm also in most cases missing context, Magit as a library, for example, means very little if you do not have a robust understanding of GIT.</p> 
<p>I did start exploring YouTube, however, and found Emacs tutorials by 'Emacs Rocks', 'Emacs jekor', and 'Nic Ferrier'.</p>

<p>My 2017 Emacs init sports some of the following additional features:</p>

<ul>
<li>shell scripting set-up</li>
<li>PHP development setup</li>
<li>Csv files from within emacs</li>
<li>Explored and tested emacs packages</li>
<li>Smart parens</li>
<li>Wgrep (just use find.exe)</li>
<li>Suped-up ESS</li>
<li>Java mode</li>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2017]</span> Linux for Dummies  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>In 2017, and in prior years, I had little to no knowledge or grasp of UNIX, which was the cause of a tremendous amount of confusion. I understood there were two systems (which was why we had used Cygwin in our consulting work), but I could not always tell when reading tutorials which tutorials and programs were UNIX specific.</p>  
<p>Chris Brown's Linux Systems Programming courses were a distraction; whatever I could find at the time. They're for system administrators learning to code linux systems. They did, however, motivate me further to other sources. 'Linux for Dummies,' for example, is the most applicable of those to my usage level. Book 7 of 'Linux For Dummies' is an excellent refresher on Bash shell scripting (Zsh, Oh-my-zsh, Fish, and Eshell). Book 5, Administration, explains well Linux system directory architecture and such permission programs as CHMOD. Book 2, Linux Desktops, is helpful in familiarizing oneself with the Linux distribution eco-system.</p>
<p>Today, I work primarily on a Windows machine but my knowledge of Linux is somewhat of a comfort when reading most blogs and/or language/system documentation. Also, many of the programs in my Windows dev-ops pipeline are UNIX programs, built with 'make' on a Linux toolchain.</p>

<h4><span class="year">[2016]</span> General</h4>

<p>In 2016, I was still a long long way away from mastering web development; conceptually, it's easy, but there are a lot of little things to figure out.
I spent most of the year working through cases at the micro-level without yet any big picture understanding of how all the little pieces fit together.</p> 

<p>Building out membership functionality on a backend with PHP, for example, was helpful in conceptualizing how membership custom pages work, but not practical outside a CMS. Learning Boostrap was helpful, but not fundamentally relevant to 'getting' CSS. Translating Bash scripts to Windows to automate system back-ups helped 'get' scripting, but transitioning from SVN to Git and writing deployment scripts was what was needed. In general, without elite mentorship, it's necessary to explore, which is time-consuming. So there is always a trade-off between the fastest way now and the fastest way every time afterward.</p> 

<p>In 2016, I also explored and learned programs for podcasting and video editing. And then there was the machine learning specialization, a distraction I enjoyed tremendously. It was 'off course', or 'back to the other course', in that machine learning is not really relevant to web development (or wasn't until AI), but it was a highly entertaining.</p>

</div>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Data Firm  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 
<p>I built out a custom PHP backend to interact with a MySQL database via PDO objects, which was an opportunity to practice SQL. In fact, that led to a full SQL course. It would have been faster to port datafirm to WordPress, but the point was to 'get' SQL and backend development.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> PHP OOP Object Oriented Programming for beginners &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Edwin Diaz's course was super cool. Once I had the gist, however, I dropped it. It was a good insight into object-oriented programming, though OOP is not really necessary for form interaction. He also has a course called 'Build a Chatbox from Scratch.' And those two courses give a pretty solid understanding of PHP (adjust for new versions) and also some initial insights into APIs. For example, a new programmer might not know that an API is also a set of programmatic responses to routes written in query languages or architectural constraints, like REST or SOAP.</p>

Edwin's course made sense out of object-oriented programming and helped conceptualize one aspect of APIs (the endpoint). 


</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Machine Learning Specialization iPython notebooks [<span class="nam">Emily Fox, Carlos Guestrin</span>]  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This was the most interesting course I started in 2016, but it isn't in my case relevant. I downloaded their videos by accident, because I wanted the SQL from a data science course on Coursera (my MOOC of choice since Roger Peng and Perry Mehrling). Their course uses iPython note books (as opposed to R), but it was so good, I couldn't stop studying it.</p>
<p>Still, I could not justify completing it and dropped it. To this day I want to finish that course! I think it would go quite nicely with some of the work Scott Moss does with Next.js and React (his Netflixish app).</p>
<p>Incidently, the course set-up involves opening a free tier account with AWS. AWS documentation and user interface, in those days anyway, was overly complex and somewhat unclear. It wasn't yet stated that instance owners are required to install firewalls on their instances on shared computers. The free tier was pay-as-you-go with a set amount of free minutes. My course work was going to come in well under free limit. So I set up the software, started the course, and didn't worry about it. The instance was quickly hacked and Amazon charged $600 to my account.</p>
<p>Amazon was of course difficult to get through to. I had to fight for it, for days, but I did manage to get them on the phone. By then I had the full-text from the EC2 instructions and that was enough to get them to reverse the charges.</p>
<p>So I ended up learning something about AWS EC2, from reading through their manuals, along with how to use iPython notebooks, which are actually quite handy, as far as cloud based python interpreters go. On top that, there is the meat and potatoes of Emily's and Carlos' course. </p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Bootstrap to Wordpress  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Brad's course demonstrated how to map predesigned templates into WordPress using the underscores theme. That is really the starting point for fullstack developers. His course together with Zack Gordon's course, which I would take in 2021, are enough backend WordPress to get building anything you want, and customizing any themes and plugins. To really 'get' WordPress development, you also need to study the functions from the manual, dump, clean, and reinstall a data base or two, troubleshoot a shwack of plugins until you have a pretty good feel for what works well. You also need to know, of course, PHP and JavaScript.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Bootstrap Docs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>At the time Bootstrap was marketed online as a must-know CSS library. After Brad's course, I was studying it as if I should know it by rote. Then I realized it was breaking the principle of separation of structure and style, which I had learned about in Andy Hunt's and David Thomas's "The Pragmatic Programmer", under the name 'orthoganility.' Then I dropped it -  it was another promise-all deliver 'whatever' gimmick.</p>

<p>In fact, I understood little about CSS then. I didn't know the DOM or CSSOM, selector specificity, or pseudo elements. I didn't understand naming conventions. I didn't know SASS or custom-CSS properties.</p>

<p>Later, when I took Victor Temprano's React intro, I could see how Bootstrap components fit easily with React components, and how in a templated architecture Bootstrap could save a lot of time.</p> 

<p>Today (2023), I do not promote Bootstrap and Tailwind, and rarely use them. But I acknowledge how helpful it can be to have modularized CSS prepared ahead of time. By all means, copy the components and paste them into your CSS or SCSS. If you will load more from the library, use orthogonality for performance reasons (modularized loading). Avoid adjusting margins or padding directly in the HTML unless you're working on single-page applications.</p>

<p>I read up on both of them and then passed. I've heard a lot about Jira, and because I use Bit Bucket so much and I understand Jira is used a lot in the industry, it's the issue and tracking software I recommend.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>In 2016, my emacs configuration is still highly minimal. I'm writing code in files and loading them with 'eval-after-load' and 'require', as opposed to using a 'use-package' with a literate programming config. My load time is terrible, as all of the custom code I'm using is loading upfront.</p>
<p>I have however, begun exploring packages and putting them to use; though I've included many libraries without knowing what they do because other's have mentioned them.</p>
<p>My configuration sports some of the following features: </p>

<ul>

<li>I'm using 'guide-key' (later I hardcoded hundreds of frequently used functions into a spoked hydra-posframe UI)</li>
<li>I have already some light frame-commands, but they're not easy to remember</li>
<li>Autocomplete is not for me, later I switched to company</li>
<li>Golden ratio mode resizes the screen into thirds when needed</li>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2016]</span> Confidence  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>In my case, there is direct correlation between my grasp of computer sciences, web development, and data science and the confidence I carry when discussing it.</p> 
<p>As you can see from the following video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWyK4_8p7yU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWyK4_8p7yU</a>, in 2016 I'm still putting all the pieces together.</p>
<p>In later years, I began a routine of reiterating material on a white board with note cards (anki), and practicing talking about it. It's necessary to communicate your expertise well. If you don't, few will have faith in it.</p> 
<p>Practicing, significantly improves my ability to communicate more clearly and charismatically.</p>

<div>

<h4><span class="year">[2015]</span> General</h4>


<p>2015 was a rubber hits the road year in terms of grasping computer sciences and web development. I spent months reading and working through piles of computer science PDFs just to get a sense of what was going on. </p>

<p>I explored the cloud and cloud technologies, including AWS, Azure, and Atlassian Cloud. I investigated futher Python, Java, C++, PHP, Drupal, and  WordPress. I hosted datafirm in the Cloud, which led to research and testing cloud technologies and interfaces.</p> 

<p>I also wrote the text content for datafirm.ca and researched legal issues in technology, in order to write terms and conditions. And then, among other things, did some rudimentary explorations into JavaScript, primarily via jQuery, building on the Harris text.</p>

</div>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>In terms of Emacs, in 2015, I was still exploring and learning basic functionality.
There is a lot of trial and error involved in the Emacs learning curve. You also need to learn to read and write some elisp, to understand, implement, and customize libraries and configurations.</p>    

<p>My Emacs initialization was quite rudimentary and minimal. </p>

<p>If I were to go down the Emacs road again, from scratch (without a preconfigured distrubition like Doom Emacs), I'd spend a few weeks to a month learning elisp first.</p> 

<p>There's no easy way to master Emacs, but if you're going to attempt it without a mentor, consultant, or senior developer on your side, you're going to need to read the libraries.</p>

<p>I had begun my Emacs journey with a windows build that included some basic set-up, ESS (Emacs Speaks Statistics), for example. See here: <a href="http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs/</a>.
I really hadn't set out to build my own custom <b>e-workshop</b>, but in the end, a custom <b>e-workshop</b> was exactly what the doctor ordered.</p>

<p>My 2015 configuration had the following functionality:</p>


<ul>
<li>Spell-checker</li>
<li>How to manage frames, windows, buffers</li>
<li>Customizations on the frame with file path, date, and time</li>
<li>Some basic theme changing</li>
<li>ESS</li>
<li>GAMS</li>
<li>A few default settings</li>
</ul>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Java All-In-One For Dummies 2  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Installed the Java runtime environment and development kit and started messing around with some programs</p>
<p>I liked that Java was statically typed, because I understood that already from exploring SQL, and some C++ (now, as a JavaScript guy, I appreciate dynamic typing)</p>
<p>I liked the concept of platform independence, but it seems in the Docker era that is no longer a reason to choose Java.</p>
<p>From what I understand now, the reason to choose Java is precedence. Java is a secure, widely used, robust language like C++ and C#, and the existing corporate code base justifies continued use.</p>   
<p>After a brief exploration, I put Java down and picked up Python</p>


</div>

<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Python Cookbook 3rd Edition  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Python is marketed often as a good 'first' programming language because it is versatile and apparently easy to learn. I say apparently, because other than youtube I had only at the time access to the Python Cookbook, which deals with subject matter that was at the time outside my comprehension. I didn't for example understand the convenience of 'unpacking', because I didn't know JavaScript enough to know how convenient destructuring can be. Now that I know JavaScript, I understand the advantages of 'unpacking.'</p>
<p>The short-story is that I dropped Python also and picked up PHP</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Programming Principles and Practice Using C++  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Bjarne Stroustrup is a captivating speaker. I started exploring C++ after watching videos of him speaking and then browsing his book, which didn't mean a lot to me then (and in the context of C++ still does not, since I'm not a C++ developer). Ultimately, I selected another C++ book "Programming Concepts in C++", by Robert Burns, before installing C++ and compiling a few programs. Then, because of work commitments I ended up dropping C++ altogether, and when I came back, I was already thinking about Content Management Systems, like Drupal and WordPress.</p>

</div>

<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> SQL All-In-One For Dummies 2nd Edition  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Some experience with SQL is mandatory. In my case, I started with a really small handbook, the title of which I no longer recall and then found a PDF copy of this one. I set up MySQL on the computer and tested out basic queries from the command -line (now, in 2023, I use MariaDB, but I would like to switch back to MySQL, and anyway use PostGres whenever possible). </p>
<p>Then I edited the emacs configuration to manage SQL. That means starting it from Emacs, writing and executing queries with a dropdown and snippet support, and syntax editing of SQL files (as well as expanding them horizontally in a legible view).</p>
<p>The process was all about practicing the basics, creating tables, specifying data types, understanding IDs, running select statements, and writing things like join statements.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>I browsed both 'Design Patterns' and 'Introduction to Algorithms' because I read they are 'must-reads' in the computer sciences, but at the time (and still today) they did not feel relevant, and consequently I did not give them the attention they possibly deserve.</p>
<p>Later, on the job market in Vancouver, I read a recommendation to study Introduction to Algorithms and revisited it.</p>
<p>I've also since revisited Design Patterns, even though it is not so much about coding but designing architecture for as an example programming languages themselves. For example, once you learn JavaScript you might view 'getters' and 'setters' as 'decorator' patterns, and identify of course patterns like 'iterators', 'prototypes', 'interperator', 'state', and 'templates'. You might also view Node middleware in the context of the 'Chain of Responsibility'.</p>
<p>Such terminology may in fact, change how you code your application, but then again, it may not ;)</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Introduction to Algorithms  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Introduction to Algorithms is basically a nasty text. You can already picture computer science professors terrorizing students with its problem sets on short-timelines.</p>
<p>If you wade into that book, you may as well wade in for a few months, there is not much point in browsing it, other than from interest (it is pretty interesting for people who like problems).</p>
<p>The problem is not the algorithms (as far as I have seen in my explorations into it), but the notation. You need to get
riemann sums, especially the nested ones, across `j` and `i` for example. You need to know asymptotic notations, like O-notation, as well as notation for some mathematical procedures, like modular arithmetic, polynomials, logarithms, factorials, functional iteration, sets, relations, functions, graphs, trees, and all that jazz.</p> 
<p>Actually, if you want to get the math in pretty much any academic paper, just read chapters 2,3, and the appendix from this text.</p>
<p>In my view, the differences between data 'analytics' and data 'science', as well as, for example, computer 'science' and coding could very well come down to a text like this one. </p>
<p>You may also find the knowledge it imparts useful during 5% of job market testing - or perhaps not.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> PHP 5.3 A Beginner's Guide  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>After exploring other languages, I went back to PHP briefly in the context of exploring Drupal, mostly from Videos.</p>
<p>I worked on code to serve custom scripts based on the URL of a given page. That functionality is standard in coding for the web, and is built-in to most CMS.</p>
<p>I quickly switched from Drupal to WordPress, because WordPress was more popular, and that is what led me to Morten Rand-Hendriksen's courses, which is how I closed out the year.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2015]</span> Revisited R  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Cleaning file-systems leads to revisiting notes from prior years, which is an opportunity to reflect and recommit knowledge to memory. That was the case with R-programming in 2015. It wasn't a focus during the year, but end-of-year, I wrote a nice little article (my opinion), for Trends Global, in which built out a chart in the style they build them at the Economist: <a href="https://trends-global.blogspot.com/2015/12/where-is-money.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://trends-global.blogspot.com/2015/12/where-is-money.html</a> I was really pleased with that one.</p>

<summary class="level_1">[2014] Summary &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>

<h4><span class="year">[2014]</span> General</h4> 
 
<p>2014 was another transitional year. I transitioned into data science, and then near the end, ultimately, web development. 
I explored Python and R and chose R, primarily because of Roger Peng, the famous Data Scientist from John Hopkins University. 
I spent some time transcribing Excel models from the Cliff Ragsdale's text into GAMS, and then took a detour back into money and banking, because Perry G. Mehrling's course was offered free on Coursera, and it made sense out of parts of my economics degree that were mysterious.</p> 
<p>The big shift for me in 2014, however, was Andy Harris' HTML & CSS for Dummies. Over 1000 pages of hands on web development material. That book, along with Computer Science an Overview 9th Edition, would set the stage for the next 9 years of study.</p>
</div>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2014]</span> HTML5 and CSS ALL-In-One   &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>The Andy Harris text was my introduction to web development, through PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Canvas Animations, Ajax, Xampp, MySQL, and PhpMyAdmin.</p> 
<p>The work is not complex, but the book is over 1000 pages. That is web development in general. At the coding level, it's not rocket science, but there is so much of it, so many bugs, and so different ways to achieve the same thing, that before you master, you will put in more or less the same effort as a rocket scientist. There is a just a ton of stuff to know.</p>

<p>In HTML5 and CSS3 For Dummies I picked up where I had left off in GAMS programming. Learning the basics of programming structures and the tools used to implement them. To achieve this, I built out a capstone project which I named Data Firm (datafirm.ca). 

I tend sometimes to wander off the beaten track during course work and start applying theory to practice before I have really a solid handle on it. That helps to commit it to memory.</p>

<p>During the course, I encountered a lot of basic computer science topics (which I didn't know were basic), like 
regular expressions, data storage languages, like JSON, Chrome's debugger, CSS transformations, forms & inputs, tables, HTML validation, developer set-up (SDKs), and of course loops, data-types, conditionals, functions, and so on...</p>

<p>In all, HTML5 and CSS3 For Dummies is a comprehensive book, and a pretty good way to get started, though it is somewhat outdated, because who uses jQuery anyway?</p>
  
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2014]</span> Computer Science an Overview 9th Edition EPUB   &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>'Computer Science an Overview' is a pretty decent introduction into comp-sci 101. In my case, I didn't get into all of it deeply, for example I mostly skipped over algorithms. Chapters 1 & 2, which lower level programming and machine operations were of particular interest to me, since they were new (keep in mind, I had been working with computers already since 2000, and had even put a few together, I'd just never read a programming book). I also got into chapters 3,4,6,7, and 8, which provide again a decent tour of operating systems, networking, languages, software engineering (), data abstractions (what is a pointer). I didn't have time to go much beyond that.</p>
<p>In all, I can recommend the book, as a quick intro into computer sciences. It covers topics in enough detail to give you a foundation without going into deep complexity.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2014]</span> Data Science Specialization Coursera   &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 
<p>The Data Science Specialization offered for free from John Hopkins was a huge course. It was hands on, and powered up, at least in terms of potential, my entire economics degree</p>
<p>This course was very hands on. It provides an excellent introduction to all aspects of Data Science.</p>
<p>Almost 10 years later, I still recommend it</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2014]</span> Data Science at Scale  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This is a really big course, but it's not very hands on</p>
<p>I ranked <span class="num">3/5</span> because I watched all of the videos, but until you configure Hadoop in the cloud and run parallel joins on it with big data, listening to Bill talk about it doesn't mean much</p>
<p>Bill Howe's course was in my case mostly entertainment. It hasn't been relevant to me yet, but who knows it could be. Anyway, it feels good to know that things like query algebra actually exist</p>
<p>Now, in terms of entertainment, Bill Howe and Roger Peng were in my opinion, from the mid-2000s and into the next 10 years, two of the most exciting data-focused professors in the business, in-terms of presentation.</p>

</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2014]</span> Economics of Money and Banking  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>I recommend this course for bankers or finanical historians/academics looking for terminology and background knowledge.</p>
<p>Perry G Mehrling studied Walter Bagehot's 'Lombard Street', and then wrote his own book, 'The New Lombard Street'.</p>
<p>As I understand it from the course, both books employ a transactional accounting approach that 'follows the money.' That was very helpful in understanding how tightly leveraged the financial system is, and ultimately how vulnerable it really is to systemic shocks, like the ABCP fiasco. There is also really good material on how banks make money over time 'matching book', and how 'outside money' can move market prices away from equilibrium.</p>   
<p>I consider Perry's course a must watch if you want to improve your understanding of, and vision in, financial markets.</p>
<p>Having said that, in my case, since I do not operate in financial markets, it was mostly entertainment/education.</p>

<h4><span class="year">[2013]</span> European Union Government Procurement Study</h4>
<ul>
<li>The European Union Government Procurement Study was an economic and legal analysis of public procurement in the EU, with trade modelling forecasts, commissioned by the government of British Columbia</li>
</ul>

An analysis of procurement laws and statistics at the major levels of government across Canada. Data collection, wrangling, modelling, research, writing, and editing by Yuri Tricys, among others. Author and Director of research, Kurt Hubner.



<h4><span class="year">[2013]</span> Irish Economic Unification Study</h4>
<ul>
<li>Data compilation was big data compilation. Excel was not enough, it only handles a million records/sheet</li>
<li>Excel was a key tool, but I had to use Microsoft Access as well</li>
<li>It was necessary to learn R to generate charts with GGPLOT</li>
<li>GAMS, or General Algebraic Modelling software, which comes with more heavy-weight solvers than Excel, provided the computational heavy-lifting</li>
<li>GAMS uses data structures, data types, loops, conditionals and functions, like other programming languages</li>
<li>Our stack included UNIX software. We installed Cygwin to get the job done</li>
<li>Versioning was done with Subversion. Diffing with Beyond Compare. Both helped later to understand what is so special about GIT (decentralized)</li>
<li>Harmonizing real trade data between classifications SITC and NAICS, and learning about trade zones as they relate to classifications and tariffs helped map theoretical course work early to the real world</li>
<li>Coding production functions (CES, COBBS-Douglas) into programs, was illustrative and helpful in conceptualizing real world economic output</li>
<li>Some problems required conceptualizing innovative solutions. For example, to disaggrate national level GDP into regional level GDP I regressed business registration data on regional GDP for comparable regions with available data</li>
<li>Modelling social transfers, balance of primary income, insurance payments, and other national accounts was again a way of mapping theory to reality</li>
<li>Modelling exercises revealed deep insights into the effects of currency changes on real world trade</li>
<li>Learning Emacs and integrating it with GAMS would set the course for the next 10 years. A robust customized mastered Emacs installation is like a custom built machinery shop. It takes a long time to build and learn to use but it makes everything you do faster and more efficient</li>
<li>Technically speaking, I spent too much time in the start on theoretical research, because I didn't know the project was really about data science and massive non-linear problem solving</li>
<li>If I had to do it again, I'd have brought a consultant in earlier. That pushed the time to completion by a few months. We want to hire as few people as possible, because we think it's cheaper, but it's usually better to bring in early a consultant who's done it before</li>

<div> 

<p>This paper was the highlight of the previous 5 years. My job was to model public procurement data extracted from the European Union's TED public procurement data base.
I also did extensive literature review of an existing corpus of papers dealing with public procurement in the EU. </p>

<p>Yes, standard EC stream research. But for a fresh graduate, straight out of an economics program, it was good work. Anytime you're doing something you've been trained to do, you're going to hit that confidence zone. "I know how to do this!"</p>

<p>Having said that, trade projects are time-intensive. We're talking 60 - 70 hours a week in front of a computer running numbers and writing text. I was already then used to it, and ten years later I'm still used to it, but I've definitely learned a thing or two over the years about ergonomics and work related health issues.</p>

<p>This paper is not available to the public.</p>

<div> 

<p>This was a long project. 60 - 70 hours a week for 18 months straight on computational general equilibrium and social accounting matrices is a marathon. It certainly makes an undergrad look a lot easier. I pictured a hedge-fund with properties in both regions and a fiduciary responsibility to model potential outcomes. I couldn't have been more surprised when it made the Financial Times.</p>

<p>For the record, everything a reader might find interesting about this project was above my pay-grade. I don't know, for example, who commissioned it, what their objectives were, or whether or not they achieved them. I don't know the state of the matter today. For example, if vibrant discussions around trade-offs in modelling exercises ever materialized. I considered myself miscast for the role. I've no connection to Ireland. Before I worked on the project, I might have thought about Ireland a few times for a few minutes, watching soccer. The Irish in the context of the United Kingdom just wasn't the kind of thing I thought about.</p>

<p>For two years, I thought about nothing else.</p> 

<p>I analyzed every minute detail, modelled every item that entered the country's record system in a year. It didn't matter if was registered into a non-tariff zone, stored, and then shipped off-island, or if it moved inland to be traded in the market. I modelled national account numbers backwards and forwards, like balance of payments and social transfers. I read the tourism surveys that came off the planes. Who's flooding England with confectioneries and delicatessens? For those years, I can tell you. How many small metal shop businesses? What kind of chemicals are produced. What are the offshore oil tariffs and who collects them? How much recorded public money travels from Ireland to the banking system in the Isle-man? What are the housing starts looking like? List some of the pretty large technical challenges in coding CGE. Those are the kind of questions relating to the years we studied I consider myself qualified to comment on. For anything else, talk to someone who lives and works there. They are the experts on everything Irish!</p>

<p>One thing I learned is that forecasting multivariate national-level models is by limitation of modern computers an exercise in positioning. Okay, so what do I mean by 'limitations of modern computers?' Well, take for example exogenously determined price-demand elasticities. That is the trade sensitivity of say the volume of imported Toyota Prius to changes in exchange rates. Those price-demand elasticities can be expressed in ranges across sectors of SITC products. That strategy would yield a stochastic distribution of results (picture a bell-curve). Results could then be expressed in distribution 'means' (averages).</p> 

<p>Instead of saying, 'these are the likely outcomes given a particular set of market conditions and market participant preferences', modellers would say: 'these are the most probable outcomes given many different sets of market conditions and market participant preferences'. The difference between the two is highly meaningful.</p>

<p>But, here is what I mean by 'computer limitations.' Take only a set of 9 integers as an elasticity range, from say -4 to +4 - don't even bother with a continuous range. Now implement that range across 99 SITC sectors and run the combinations with a fast computer. That's called combinations with replacement, '9 choose 99'. The model would run 325,949,656,825 times!</p> 

<p>Let's say your job was to run the model every 3 minutes for 5 8 hour days with a 1 hour lunch break, until you tested all combinations. That's roughly 36,500 iterations in a year. 325,949,656,825 would take you somewhere around 8,930,128 years. You could put the entire city of New York to work on the job and finish the task in more-or-less a year.</p> 

<p>Now of course bigger computers run iterations and record results faster than 3 minutes per iteration, and they can run them 24 hours a day all year long. Also, the algorithm matters (solver); if it's a sort, is 'insert' or is it 'merge', and a quantum computer can do it even faster! But you're still talking about a huge time-frame and a huge budget, and that's just the trade elasticities, forget about exchange rates or whatever other exogenous variables the modellers choose.</p>

<p>[Also, consider the impact of variables and industries on change magnitudes. While some models have more than 600 functions, it's quite plausible a model with far few functions could more or less do the job]</p>

<p>Data panel compilation is another problem. Publicly available national level statistics are everywhere tightly controlled. Those numbers push foreign direct investment. What is published can be sparse, and anyway comes from sources with different collection and processing pipelines. In one case, they are surveying business leaders, in another case tourists. Some data come from import export records, straight from the port. Other data from the taxation authority. Mixing those data together into one comprehensive panel is like positioning magnifying glasses of different magnitudes over a map of numbers on a board room table. The fonts are everywhere different sizes./p>

<p>That's not an unusual phenomenon in economic modelling, it's par for the course. Better panel data uses changes across collection periods, to sharpen and harmonize those out-of-sync 'fonts'. Yes, of course statistics agencies should harmonize collection processes, and you can be assured they take the steps they can to do that. But social accounting matrix compilation should be a matter of more than one panel of data, or each proverbial 'magnifying glass' should be sharpened and harmonized across time, not just laterally across data sources.</p>

<p>CGE is still one of the more interesting applications in computational economics; and, as far as I know, it's still the most advanced technology for the problem. It highlights key relevant areas in policy scenarios, like the effects of harmonization on public spending. But, it certainly isn't easy!</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2013]</span> Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This book turned out to be a red-herring (not relevant), in terms of the deliverables in front of me, but, as it happens, is still a well-known resource in economics studies at the masters level. It's really about mapping economic thought into the language of maths (sets, calculus, sums, etc...). 
<p>For anyone that will pursue a masters in economics, this is not a bad resource to explore. It's just the same old calculus problems, but presented in the context of economics. That will be helpful if you will ever read economics papers, because you will recognize the problem set from the math.</p> 
<p>For example, if it's partial or full differential mathemetics, you will understand it as a problem with non-linear or linear constraints, solvable with a solver. And if you're looking at matrix inversion, again, you will see it as a system of equations.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[2013]</span> Emacs  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>
<p>In order to run the GAMS simulations during the unification study, I was taught Emacs.</p>
<p>I really had no idea what it was under-the-hood, but everyone who is 'taught' to work with Emacs, in academia anyway, is taught to drop the mouse and embrace the keyboard with `C-n` and `C-p`. After a few weeks of that, typically, Emacs is the way. To this day, I've no complaints.</p>

<p>I produced the charts, wrote and edited some of the text on the following paper in a short-time frame. That's what analysts do, the menial stuff senior researchers and administrators don't have time for. When you get good at it, it's a good time, because you have systems in place to make the work easier and to produce a polished final product. In those days, I was working with Excel and Open Office on a crappy buzzy (not grounded) laptop. There wasn't really much fun in it, just grinding.</p>

<li>Explored, for a potential job interview, the Oxygen Editor and DITA in the context of single source publishing.

<li>Worked through 'Technical Writing for Dummies', also, which was helpful in conceptually repackaging years of writing practice and knowledge.</li>
<li>Then I spent some library time with Latex. It turned out to be a 'fleeting' experience, because I didn't have the knowledge storage, searching, and testing systems I have in place today. Later, when I learned Latex properly, I didn't remember much from Peter Flynn and Tobias Oetiker PDFs. I had to read it all again, and again, and again</li>

<h4><span class="year">[2011]</span> Seminar in Applied Economics</h4>

<p>This was my favorite paper. The job was to model the effects of NAFTA on Sector Productivity. When compared to papers previously published by students in the seminar courses, I could easily been earned toward 90% in this course, but I was already running toward an 80% final average for my undergrad, based on some earlier catastrophes. Also, my work on this project was not exceptional, but it did pass all the criteria for a good paper. The main thing I learned from course (other than regression analysis) was about expectations and impressions. In the mid-course interview, the instructor was concerned and I didn't succeed in conveying enough confidence in a successful project completion. The truth is, at that point I already had the journal of papers published by previous years and I knew what the expectations were. But my schedule was overloaded, and I hadn't yet scheduled the time to figure out the next bits that really mattered, which were where I was going to get the data and how I was going to process it. What I had was all of these little parcels of work that were 50% done. It looked like I was behind schedule, but I was actually ahead of schedule. It was just about scheduling. In my view, a decent paper was the obvious outcome, but I was looking for confirmation from the instructor that the was the case. When confronted with doubt, I started doubting. "What had I missed here?" When I handed in the final paper, the instructor was relieved. I realized, I hadn't done a good enough job communicating what I was doing. For anyone reading this, make extra efforts to ensure your work is an extension of your supervisor's work.</p>

<h4>[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] General</h4>

<ul>
<li>My first semester at UBC increases my study hours drastically. I start studying more than 30 hours per week. I essentially open and close the library, breaking only for classes</li>
<li>Some of my instructors do not realize I open and close the library every day. This is primarily because even with my super solid study habits, the course load takes some getting used to. I fail to make it clear to them how hard I'm working. That is a lesson that takes it toll. I make notes to learn to be more diplomatic, but do not really figure out how to do that until years later. Learning diplomacy is not much different than learning computer programming. You figure out what you don't know and what you don't do well, you put together some activities you can practice to get better, and you get to work. If you can, I recommend taking some drama classes or working a sales job.</li>
<li>The other guy who opens and closes the library is studying to be a dentist</li>
<li>I live among 10 other students. I am the oldest in the house.</li>
<li>I skip some of the fall semester and leave town for work. It costs me, but I hang in there to post reasonable grades. An 80% average. No one seems to care about grades anyway. </li>
</ul>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Volunteer for Student Paper  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>My schedule was over-loaded. There was no time to hang around the student union and defend my submissions. Submitting articles to journalism students who don't know you from Adam is risky.

You need to defend your work. My first submission was published full-page on the back of the paper with a graphic of the then premier with horns on his head next to the words 'HST Is the Devil!'. The title I submitted was 'Dealing With the HST'.</p> 

<p>I laugh now, but it wasn't a laughing matter then. Any professor has the power to torpedo you. And all it takes is slight misread of your intention or position.</p>
 
<p>The problem was that the HST in BC was hugely controversial. Later, it was overthrown in the first ever referendum on the tax system. As an economics student, my position was that tax harmonization was a good thing, at a lower tax rate than the one implemented. In my article however, I left it up to the reader to decide for themselves. The journalism students edited my position to go, one could argue somewhat belligerently, against the HST.</p>

<p>I did what I could to minimize the damage.</p>

<p>My next submissions, on what was then Bill-C50, was 'ho-hum;' nobody cared. In retrospect, me writing on political subject material when I hadn't yet taken any political science courses and didn't know the first thing about the people I was writing about was like getting ChatGTP to write. I was writing purely from research other people had published, which isn't journalism, it's literature review.</p>

<p>The third submission, 'Strong Dollar Could Be Good for Canada' was deemed 'too esoteric,' which in my view was a fair assessment. A student paper is not the place to emulate the 'Financial Times.' And, in any case, my schedule just kept getting busier.</p>

<div> 

<p>These projects were among my favorites during my time at UBC. The type of students who volunteer for student associations are always keen. It was fun working with them. </p>

<p>We set up a program to pitch to students and mentors, pitched it, selected applicants, and then arranged events to match students with mentors. A good time, and instructive.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Tutoring Students  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Also through the ESA, I would tutor students privately. Myself and other enterprising students placed ads on the website cleverly constructed by a member of our association. I was surprised at the number of students who contacted me.</p>

<p>Actually, it presented a problem, because those students needed tutoring when I also had exams, not to mention the fact that in those days I had no idea how to teach.</p>

<p>I developed a strategy to make it easier on me. I collected my own tests, gathered tests from others, and asked the students to bring me their previously written tests. I analyzed the tests and because I knew something of the professors, taught those students that needed it what to expect on any given test. The strategy was not about teaching economics, it was about teaching students to prepare for specific types of testing against informed predictions. That strategy paid off for the types of students that chose me over the other tutors. I had a few athletes come in who hadn't attended any of their classes. They had made deals with their instructors to put their entire grade on the final exam. We narrowed down what they needed to learn to reasonable levels, and put them on a program to prepare themselves to jump the hurdles. Somewhat to my surprise, both students cleared their respective hurdles. The following year I purchased a coffee well off-campus and one of those students was sitting there. "That's the guy who taught me how to study!" Her beaming smile and genuine gratitude lifted me up at a time when I sorely needed it!</p>

<p>Some students hired me also who knew everything! Then I was occassionaly corrected and had to just sit listen. That was also a learning experience.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Studying for Tests  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>How you study for tests makes all the difference. Start at the beginning the semesters. Get a list of the tests and do everything you can to find out what is going to be on it. Your job is to pick through the material and write notecards that match the questions that will be on the test. In the start, I didn't do that, because I'm the kind of guy that wants to know everything forever. But again, time is what you don't have and time is what it takes. Prepare your notecards, study them weeks in advance several times. For big really serious tests, you need to write no-look practice tests with a timer. If you can get the questions right, put in the time, and make sure you're rested, you can make it through. A big part of it is detective work. Think about it, where is your professor getting his/her material? You will probably see their source on their desk, or they will be chatting happily about it. In most cases, they've already given you a copy, you just have to figure which one it is.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Navigating Expectations  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Earning an undergraduate degree is really about time management, diplomacy, and study methodology. Time is what you don't have. Instructors put excessive claims against it. Moreover, they have a lot of students and they're also under time pressure. They don't know if you're carrying on at night at a frat party or opening and closing the library. They don't know your commute and they don't know your living conditions. What they know is how often you're exhausted (weak), when you're confident and when you're not, and what and how you present.
Just like in the work place, you need to learn about your instructor. You need to know what they think of you and if they're correct about it. If not, you have to find a way to put your case forward. If you're putting in 90 hour weeks, the professors and instructors need to know about it. When your test is incorrectly marked, you need to get in there and defend it. You also need to make sure decisions regarding your work are approved. You may think of it as your work, but it isn't. It's the professor or instructor's work. That sounds crazy, like 'who wrote this paper anyway,' but it's helpful to think of it that way because your job is to learn from them. As much as possible, your work should be a collaborative effort between you and your instructor.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Jumping Hurdles  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Hurdles are traps set by professors and administrators to finish you. The 40/40/20 is a classic trap. The first paper is 40% of the mark, the second paper is another 40% of the mark. The final test is only 20%, no escape for you, you have to attend the classes. The hurdle is that the first and second paper are only 10 days to 2 weeks a part, "groan". You have to figure out that you have to write the two papers at the same time. Your job is to find out what those papers will be on, and make sure you're writing them to your instructors preference. 40/40/20 is a deadly hurdle.</p>

<p>Another deadly hurdle comes from the university administration. It rains down on you like a mortar. Let's say you're taking 5 courses, 2 of them are really tough. You're also volunteering, and then you skip town for a weekend to make some money. The end of the semester blends into Christmas break. Your 5 exams will be spread out across a 20 day period. You get the schedule, and all 5 of them are in the first week. You have 2 days before it starts and 1 day in the middle to prepare to jump 5 serious hurdles. That is an administrative veto on your semester. You're going to have to argue a case against the schedule or find a way around it. You will also need to cut your losses and let your profits run. You might for example predict the test where you will be graded against the most harshly and accept it as a loss. Work at minimizing the damage, you still have to pass, but focus on putting your effort into the tests you can ace. Those higher grades are going to rescue your average.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Collaboration  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Life is a team game, and school is no different. Most students are open to some form of collaboration. Study groups, direct trades, and tutors and par for the course. One strategy I employed was to approach students and ask to see their papers. If they shared them, I would have some idea about the level of work that might be considered good. I also sought out publications. I was lucky. The seminar course for my degree demanded a final thesis-like paper, and the department was publishing a journal with of the best papers from previous years. That journal set the bar for what constitued a 'good' paper. If I hadn't found that, my final paper would have certainly been lacking. In my case, no one pointed that journal out to me. I just happened to have the foresight to go looking for publications. If you're an undergrad and you're reading this, definitly ask all of the instructors for samples. Also, ask other students. </p>

<p>Direct trading means you do half the homework and I do the other half. Pick your trade partners wisely. I was lucky in direct trades, I split the work with some pretty smart students. One fellow, who went on to work at both Google and Microsoft, the kind of guy who's face was on the cover of the engineering magazines floating around around campus, was trading homework with me. His notekeep strategy was pretty good. Firstly it was digital, and secondly, optimized toward probable test questions. It turns out, he was taking 7 courses that semester, which was comparable but still more than my 5 courses plus volunteering. I asked how he did it, and he responded something like 'program selection.' 'I'm in engineering, we only need 50% to get our ring. That's all that's expected. You can learn from other students. </p>
<p>When trading answers however be careful. In a study group, it's not uncommon that you and one other person will carry the load while others leach. Make sure you're getting something out of it. That can happen also in direct trades. I had one trading partner that didn't do any of the difficult questions, and in the end when there was an assigment I simply didn't have time to do, he wouldn't do it either. It was better for me to stick with the deal because doing 65% of the work is still better than doing 100% and deal making depends a lot on who is talking to whom in the classroom, but you should still pick study partners as carefully as you can.</p>
<p>I can't comment on tutors and 'study consultants,' as I've never hired any, but when I was hired, the money certainly helped, and I think in some cases I saved a student or two their GPA.</p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] Introduction to Econometrics  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This was the hardest course that I took. Primarily because there was no sense that I could control the outcome. It was challenging to interpret and predict what it would take to get a good grade. The uncertainty spilled into the exams. Also of course, the material was tough. The worse part was that the grades for the final exam came in before Christmas, and everyone failed. After Christmas, the grades were scaled. Welcome to econometrics, students, my little sister could do a better job than you! </p>

<summary class="level_2">[<span class="year">2009 - 2011</span>] International Macroeconomics and Finance  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This was my favorite course, based only on the material. We were given an early PDF copy of the text book found in this link: <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691170640/international-macroeconomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691170640/international-macroeconomics</a> I wish I could share it with you. By that point, the models were making sense to me (keep in mind, I was reading Keynes before I returned to finish my degree). And anyway, I'm a macroeconomic kind of thinker. In colleged, in my 20s I took a statistical thermodynamics course, which had, for some reason, a ton of astrophysics mathmematics. Proving Keplers law from arbitrary coordinate systems in space changed my world view. I literally see the world in my mind as if its the Google Earth app, zoomed out. 
Everything about the course was interesting.</p>

<ul>
<li>Determinants of the real exchange rate</li>
<li>Changes in aggregate spending</li>
<li>International Capital Market Integration</li>
<li>Etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>The models give you what you have learned to expect, which is responses to shocks in exogenous variables, like currencies.</p>

<p>40/40/20 papers. My papers were not exceptional, but there were no reason they could be screened out. At that level, you're just writing literature review. You don't have any of your own data, and you don't know enough or have the time to run any back of the envelope models, or come up with anything that is 'real-world' insightful. You're just reading papers and thinking about how things in closed systems work. I post them here not because they're good, or you should copy them, but because they were produced from reading a lot of papers in crazy short time frames in a double hurdle scenario in a landslide of other assignments and commitments.</p>

<div> 

<p>Truth be told, I did not excel at politics. There is a certain enthusiasm for social gatherings that both politicians and celebrities bring. As far as wonks go, when I've battened down the hatches and secured a decent trade wind in other areas, I'm actually not that bad in the charm department, but I'm not the front-man, and when I'm short-handed it's hit and miss.</p>

<p>This activity however showed me a little bit of how politics works in the real the world. Essentially, the role is to put time and energy into groups of people, which just like everything else, takes a little practice and a little preparation! Then you're good to go. Also, there is a lot of paper floating around, but the real decisions are hammered out on the convention floor.</p>
<p>My suggestion to analysts, programmers, deep thinkers, scientists, writers, who are not socially gifted [or tradesmen and contractors, for that matter] is to set aside some time to practice the usual salutations and interactions. They're largely standardized, and there is plenty of material on exactly how to do it. It's just like studying for an exam. Come up with the things you are supposed to say, and practice saying them in the way they should be said. Presto, an instant hit! [It's actually more complicated than that, because there are always critics, and you have to perform with them waiting for an opportunity to criticize and rally other critics, but as you get more experienced, your skin gets thicker!]</p>

<div>

<p>There are too many projects to mention in my early-life. For the most part there were jobs. The experiences cannot really be disaggregated from everything else. In my experience, intellectual thoughts and past-times are also connected to certain instincts. I was writing when I was a kid. I just wasn't any good at it and didn't do it as often. It was much the same thing with studying. I was the Valedictorian of my high-school, it was just a small school and nobody else read the text-books like I did.</p>

<p>While a lot of things happened in my early life, some pushed the enveloped more than others. Probably the most widely relatable project was starting a moving company.</p>

<h4><span class="year">[PRE2009]</span> Office Move Direct </h4>


<p>Office Move Direct was a moving company project. It was a success in that there were foundational skill-sets I was missing prior to OMD. Leadership was one of them. Others include:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Building a marketing system</li>
<li>Writing designing and building marketing collateral</li>
<li>Researching legal factors of office relocations</li>
<li>Interviewing and hiring staf</li>
<li>Incorporation and managing company books</li>
<li>Year end reporting</li>
<li>Managing payroll</li>
<li>Estimating relocation bids</li>
<li>Making deals</li>
<li>Peforming relocations</li>
<li>Financing operations</li>
</ul>

<p>The OMD project pushed me to perform outside of my abilities. That came with additional stresses, and my body responded. Leading teams of up to 15 people on a given operation is standard for millions of contractors, but I was new to it, and my  prefrontal cortex, which is the area of your brain that is responsible for executive function, felt it.</p>

<p>I ran OMD for around 15 months and relocated a lot of offices, some of them pretty large, up to 7 5-ton truckloads. The experience strengthened my leadership abilities. I do not consider myself an executive leader, but my prefrontal cortex has developed into something more than it was before OMD. I learned that just like with your body, you can build parts of your brain that are under-developed through activities.</p>

<p>That seems elementary, of course you can, the human organism is flexible. It changes, grows, overcomes deficiencies. We are remarkably adaptive creatures, but at the time, I believed I was saddled with predefined characteristics. Office Move Direct taught me that I can grow in new ways.</p>

<p>If I can, if you want to, so can you!</p>

<p>The other thing I learned from Office Move Direct was that I'm an analyst at heart.</p> 

<p>
I'm definitely not one of those people that thinks in terms of white-color/blue-color identities. I believe the human organism is incredible adaptable and that people from different walks of life and backgrounds can engage in different activities and over-time perform them successfully, and even excellently. I did not get into studying because I felt other activities were 'lowly'. I just always engaged in activities that kept me 'locked-in' on things like puzzles, lego, or painting led figures.</p>   

<p>The moving business was also full of talented contractors. Office Move Direct had a clever bidding system, attractive marketing collateral, bullet proof legal contracts, risk-assessments, pro-formas, year-end reports, all of the DNA of business, but it was missing those elements of 'swagger' and executive function that are particularily suited to fleet captainship. I knew after Office Move Direct I was a better analyst than a fleet 'commander'. </p>

<div> 

<p>I averaged an hour a day for years outside of the school system. I purchased my own text books and worked through them. In the beginning my moto was 'You're not really studying until it's difficult,' but after a few years, it got easier. And then it got mandatory, something you just had to do.</p>

<p>In 2008, I wintered at the university campus, bought my own text-books, and ran a study schedule in the library with my own syllabus. 40 - 50 hours a week in the books. Occassionally, I snuck into lectures.</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of the campus life brought me back from my own world. I followed up on a suggestion, and applied to finish my degree.</p> 

<p>Because of the winter of 2008, I ennrolled in University and amped up my study discipline to 50+ hours a week.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[PRE2009]</span> Lithuanian Studies  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>I summered in Lithuania two years in a row and studied the Lithuanian language. The first at the University of Klaipeda and the second year at a language school in Vilnius. The second year, I hired a personal tutor. </p>

<p>Lithuanian is an interesting language to study. It has a complex structure based on 7 declensions and an entire world of prefixes and suffixes. In any given sentence, the words fit together like a puzzle; every word changes when one word changes. Of course, it's not exactly like that, there are charts and practices. And let me tell you, the subtleties in the spoken and pronounciation are intricate.</p>

<p>In general, my time in Lithuania was spiritually uplifting and wordly, as summer travels generally are.</p>

<div> 

<p>I wasn't a model Langara student until my last years there. I consider myself lucky to have the course exposure I had.</p>
 
<p>We can all related to heartfelt films featuring challenged youths navigating pitfalls and 'kettles.' A little luck here and there, some mentorship and some support can turn everything around.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[PRE2009]</span> HIST 2237 Popes, Emperors and Kings [Langara]  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>Personally, I was influenced to bring my discipline and focus online; I didn't untap my potential myself, I had help.</p>

<p>Barry Brill, the history professor, probably doesn't remember me or know how much his class influenced my future of study, as a disciple, passion, practice, and hobby. He was giving me Bs on everything I handed him.</p>

<p>In an ideal scenario, someone forms a bond with you and gets through to you verbally: "Look kid, you can really excel here if you just put your heart into it, and heart means time!" That didn't happen to me. Barry sparked my interest because he wouldn't give me an A. I'd rather have a 'Dead Poets Society' any day.</p>

<p>I finally went in to Barry and said 'What is going on here! I'm trying everything I can and I keep getting the same result?!' He replied, 'you're not writing the paper like I am. I've given you samples. Your job is not to write a story, your job is to interpret historical documents and make a case for a story with references!'</p>

<p>The truth was I was working part-time and writing whatever I wanted was faster. To write what he wanted, I had to triple my hours in. I've always had the laser focus, I just had to apply it to his class instead of fantasy novels and basketball.</p>

<p>When I finally started putting in the big hours, I made the decision to keep at it after the school year finished.</p> 

<p>I've been studying as a lifestyle, practice, and hobby ever since.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[PRE2009]</span> ENGL 2235 American Literature [Langara]  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>This course was memorable to me not because of the material we covered, but because there were two papers due which presented the first opportunity to apply theories about structure, learned from Barry Brill's classes, to expository essays.</p>

<p>I'm not saying American Literature is not interesting. In fact, to this day I occassionally read a few sentences or a few paragraphs from Hemmingway, or even Poe. I'm saying writing a paper into a proper structure (or at least non-disastrous structure, which was the case with those papers) is a rewarding and memorable experience. </p>

<p>Everytime I've written something that came together well, I've remembered the experience.</p>

<summary class="level_2"><span class="year">[PRE2009]</span> PHYS 1225 Physics II With Calculus [Langara]  &nbsp;+</summary>
<div> 

<p>From my time at Langara, I remember three physics courses: Newtonian Mechanics, Thermodynamics & Heat, and Physics II with calculus.</p>

<p>Newtonian Mechanics was memorable because I found an english translation of Newton's own "Natural Philosophy Principles of Mathematics." It didn't help me much, but it got me to do some of the assignments from A.P. French's "Newtonian Mechanics The M.I.T introductory physics series," which is a really nice textbook that comes to mind whenever I think about the physical sciences.</p>

<p>I didn't study much of it, but it is still on my shelf today (the translation of "Natural Philosophy Principles of Mathematics" is gone, sadly)</p>

<p>Thermodynamics & Heat was interesting because the prof spent several lectures on astrophysics. No-one understood what he was doing or why, because he was a bit of a babbler, but I did manage to conceptualize relative (arbitrary) frames of reference, which are needed, of course to calculate trajectories in space.</p>

<p>The notion of viewing Earth from space was new to me (we did not have Google Earth then), and 'zooming' out quickly became a habit. I became one of those people who views humanity as a complete integral entity, at the default setting. Perhaps you're familiar with the notions of 'man vs man' (Joseph Conrad's, 'The Duel'), 'man vs nature' (survival in the wilderness), and 'man vs mankind' (human progress as a species). Social scientists often go in for the latter view. Much like doctor's view the body, the social scientist will zoom out and view humanity.</p>   
<p>It is also that habit of zooming out that led me eventually to economics.</p>


<p>Finally, Physics II with Calculus, my favorite all time physics course.</p> 

<p>Physics II with Calculus was all about electrics, light, batteries, etc. The only calculus we did was calculating flows of energy across spheres with Gausses law.</p> 

<p>We did a lot of examination of things like 'Kerkoff's Loop rules (splling), batteries, switches, capacitors, ray tubes - all that exciting stuff that led our species eventually to computers, modern 4k TVs, and Teslas.</p>

<p>At the time, it was just the most interesting course ever.</p>
