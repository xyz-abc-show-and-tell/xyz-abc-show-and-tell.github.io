      <description>&lt;p&gt;The text discusses strategies for overcoming resistance to learning, as outlined in Stephen&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Skillful Teacher&amp;rdquo;. Resistance to learning can be a significant obstacle in the teaching process, and understanding its causes is key to addressing it. The chapter highlights the importance of getting students involved in the learning process, using a variety of teaching methods, and creating a receptive state for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-strategies-for-addressing-resistance-to-learning&#34;&gt;Key Strategies for Addressing Resistance to Learning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sort out the causes of resistance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Determine if the resistance is justified&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research students&amp;rsquo; backgrounds and cultural values&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Involve former resisters in the learning process&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Model desired behavior and discussions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Involve students in educational planning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a variety of teaching methods and approaches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Assess learning incrementally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ensure intentions are clearly understood&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Build a case for learning&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create situations in which students can succeed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid pushing too fast&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Admit the normality of resistance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Limit negative effects of resistance&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen offers some perspective on why he goes into detail in the chapter on each of the above topics in this quote:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;5 years is a long time. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Steve Jobs has to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think about a year or two, three down the road; we have some projects at Apple that are sort of maybe four years down the road. Five years? Probably like three or four at the most, because things change too much&amp;hellip; you can be going down a path, you say, &amp;lsquo;Well in 5 years I want to be here,&amp;rsquo; but then something new happens and you just say, &amp;lsquo;Forget that, I want to be over there.&amp;rsquo; So most of this 5-year planning that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life—some of it&amp;rsquo;s essential, but most of it changes too quickly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In terms of learning activities and growth after the PIDP, I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be much to learn and much to grow into.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I can predict what I will need to learn next year now, because there are many variables in the term &amp;rsquo;next year&amp;rsquo;, but I am certain it&amp;rsquo;s going to be new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only is the world changing rapidly, but I have put in huge amounts of effort during the last decade into upskilling to be &amp;lsquo;of use&amp;rsquo; in what was then the future reality, and what is now modern day knowledge work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 18 &amp;lsquo;Exercising Teacher Power Responsibly&amp;rsquo; speaks to the elephant in the room: who is charge and what power they hold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen addresses teaching from the perspective of &amp;rsquo;teacher power&amp;rsquo;, which he describes as the power to influence or create the curriculum, decide what constitutes &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;excellent&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;poor&amp;rsquo; performance, and punish and reward students in front of their peers with grades and disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the headings from the chapter:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Brookfield Chapter 2: The Core Assumptions of Skillful Teaching</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brookfield chapter 2: The Core Assumptions of Skillful Teaching contains in my view some bits of wisdom that can be applied to many aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But first here are the opening points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skillful teaching is whatever helps students learn&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skillful teachers adopt a critically reflective stance toward their practice&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most important knowledge that skillful teachers need to do good work is a constant awareness of how students are experiencing their learning and perceiving teacher&amp;rsquo;s actions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;College students of any age should be treated as adults.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These may sound boring, but Stephen goes on to describe one technique he uses to achieve the first one, which is to walk out of the classroom and leave the students with a panel former students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming indispensable for teachers. These technologies don&amp;rsquo;t aim to replace educators but rather to enhance their capabilities and free up valuable time for meaningful student interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-promise-of-ai-in-education&#34;&gt;The Promise of AI in Education&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Using AIEd, teachers will be able to offer learners educational experiences that are more personalised, flexible, inclusive and engaging&amp;rdquo; (Luckin &amp;amp; Holmes, 2016). This powerful observation from researchers highlights how AI can transform traditional teaching approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;ethics-and-ai-in-teaching-navigating-the-complexities&#34;&gt;Ethics and AI in Teaching: Navigating the Complexities&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, artificial intelligence tools present both opportunities and significant ethical challenges for educators. As these technologies become increasingly integrated into classrooms, teachers must thoughtfully consider their implications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confirmation bias, for example, is a significant challenge. When students use AI tools, they often phrase queries in ways that lead to responses confirming their preexisting beliefs. As noted by Atos researchers, &amp;ldquo;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a flaw of the GenAI itself but a result of how we interact with it&amp;hellip; steer[ing] the conversation to echo our existing beliefs and overlook counterarguments&amp;rdquo; (Atos, 2024). This cognitive bias can limit critical thinking rather than enhance it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where artificial intelligence increasingly shapes our world, developing AI literacy has become essential for both students and teachers. AI literacy is more than understanding how AI works-it&amp;rsquo;s about cultivating the ability to critically evaluate, effectively use, and ethically navigate AI technologies in educational contexts and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-ai-literacy&#34;&gt;Understanding AI Literacy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI literacy can be defined as &amp;ldquo;the knowledge and skills that enable humans to critically understand, evaluate, and use AI systems and tools to safely and ethically participate in an increasingly digital world&amp;rdquo; (Digital Promise, 2024). This multifaceted concept encompasses technical understanding, critical evaluation, practical application, and ethical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In our increasingly complex educational landscape, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) offer promising tools for developing critical thinking skills in students. These computerized learning environments incorporate models from cognitive sciences, learning sciences, artificial intelligence, and other fields to create personalized learning experiences (Graesser et al., 2011).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critical thinking, defined as &amp;ldquo;the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action&amp;rdquo; (Scriven &amp;amp; Paul, 2003), represents a crucial skill for today&amp;rsquo;s learners. ITS can help develop these skills through adaptive interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how we approach student assessment, offering both exciting opportunities and important challenges for educators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-changing-face-of-assessment&#34;&gt;The Changing Face of Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AI technologies are revolutionizing educational assessment practices, moving beyond traditional methods to create more personalized and effective evaluation processes. As UNESCO notes, &amp;ldquo;Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in education today, innovate teaching and learning practices, and accelerate progress towards SDG 4&amp;rdquo; (Unesco, n.d.). This transformation isn&amp;rsquo;t merely about replacing pen-and-paper with technology, but rather represents a fundamental shift in our approach to assessment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Teacher Training for AI Integration: Bridging the Knowledge Gap</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept but a present reality that teachers must navigate. Effective professional development for AI integration has become essential for educators who want to stay current and leverage these powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that while AI education is often prioritized in national strategies, it remains underdeveloped in teacher training programs (European Schoolnet, 2024). The gap between policy and practice creates challenges for educators seeking to meaningfully incorporate AI into their classrooms. According to a study applying the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework to AI learning, &amp;ldquo;much of the current discussion of artificial intelligence, including its use in educational settings, has been built on a fundamental misunderstanding of these technologies&amp;rdquo; (Arizona State University, 2023). This highlights the need for structured, comprehensive AI literacy programs for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
