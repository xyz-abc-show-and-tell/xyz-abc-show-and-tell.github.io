      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;throwing-in-the-towel-before-the-game-begins&#34;&gt;Throwing in the Towel Before the Game Begins&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: You’re in a lecture hall listening to a professor drone on &amp;ndash; you were interested a few classes ago, but now, to be honest, you have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on &amp;ndash; when a peer raises her hand and asks yet another brilliant question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She always seems to think and speak effortlessly, grasping ideas and formulating arguments with remarkable speed and clarity? Perhaps you feel a pang of self-doubt, convinced, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just don’t have the wiring for this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;5 years is a long time. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Steve Jobs has to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think about a year or two, three down the road; we have some projects at Apple that are sort of maybe four years down the road. Five years? Probably like three or four at the most, because things change too much&amp;hellip; you can be going down a path, you say, &amp;lsquo;Well in 5 years I want to be here,&amp;rsquo; but then something new happens and you just say, &amp;lsquo;Forget that, I want to be over there.&amp;rsquo; So most of this 5-year planning that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my life—some of it&amp;rsquo;s essential, but most of it changes too quickly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
