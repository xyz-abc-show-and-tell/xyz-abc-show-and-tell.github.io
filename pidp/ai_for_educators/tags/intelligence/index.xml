      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;nbsp&#34;&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping how we interact with knowledge, compelling educational systems to evolve beyond outdated models. As the OECD warns in Elliott et al., 2024, AI&amp;rsquo;s ability to outperform humans in reasoning and problem-solving means schools must prioritize intellectual growth, creativity, and civic engagement over mere skill acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Central to this transition are &lt;em&gt;adaptive feedback loops&lt;/em&gt; (AFLs) &amp;ndash; dynamic systems where learners, educators, and AI collaborate to build responsive, ever-improving learning environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;throwing-in-the-towel-before-the-game-begins&#34;&gt;Throwing in the Towel Before the Game Begins&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: You’re in a lecture hall listening to a professor drone on &amp;ndash; you were interested a few classes ago, but now, to be honest, you have no idea what&amp;rsquo;s going on &amp;ndash; when a peer raises her hand and asks yet another brilliant question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She always seems to think and speak effortlessly, grasping ideas and formulating arguments with remarkable speed and clarity? Perhaps you feel a pang of self-doubt, convinced, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I just don’t have the wiring for this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
