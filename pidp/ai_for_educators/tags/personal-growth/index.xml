      <description>&lt;p&gt;5 years is a long time. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Steve Jobs has to say about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think about a year or two, three down the road; we have some projects at Apple that are sort of maybe four years down the road. Five years? Probably like three or four at the most, because things change too much&amp;hellip; you can be going down a path, you say, &amp;lsquo;Well in 5 years I want to be here,&amp;rsquo; but then something new happens and you just say, &amp;lsquo;Forget that, I want to be over there.&amp;rsquo; So most of this 5-year planning that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in my lifeâ€”some of it&amp;rsquo;s essential, but most of it changes too quickly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
