      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly evolving educational landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a futuristic concept but a present reality that teachers must navigate. Effective professional development for AI integration has become essential for educators who want to stay current and leverage these powerful tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that while AI education is often prioritized in national strategies, it remains underdeveloped in teacher training programs (European Schoolnet, 2024). The gap between policy and practice creates challenges for educators seeking to meaningfully incorporate AI into their classrooms. According to a study applying the TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework to AI learning, &amp;ldquo;much of the current discussion of artificial intelligence, including its use in educational settings, has been built on a fundamental misunderstanding of these technologies&amp;rdquo; (Arizona State University, 2023). This highlights the need for structured, comprehensive AI literacy programs for teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
