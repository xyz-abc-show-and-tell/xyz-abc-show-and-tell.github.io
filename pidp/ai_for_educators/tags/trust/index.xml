      <description>&lt;p&gt;Brookfield chapter 2: The Core Assumptions of Skillful Teaching contains in my view some bits of wisdom that can be applied to many aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But first here are the opening points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skillful teaching is whatever helps students learn&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Skillful teachers adopt a critically reflective stance toward their practice&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most important knowledge that skillful teachers need to do good work is a constant awareness of how students are experiencing their learning and perceiving teacher&amp;rsquo;s actions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;College students of any age should be treated as adults.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These may sound boring, but Stephen goes on to describe one technique he uses to achieve the first one, which is to walk out of the classroom and leave the students with a panel former students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
