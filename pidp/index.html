<p style="text-align:left;width:100%;">Trends In Adult Education - AI</p>


<p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education is a significant trend that is reshaping how we learn and teach.</p> 


<p>Click the image below to read an article about AI trends in adult education, written by Serhii Uspenskyi.</p>


<a href="https://springsapps.com/knowledge/main-ai-trends-in-education-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img class="org-image" alt="trends_adult_education.jpg" src="./media/trends_adult_education.jpg" loading="lazy">
</a></br>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Source: https://springsapps.com/knowledge/main-ai-trends-in-education-2024]</p>



<p>Here are some of the key trends mentioned in the post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Generative AI to Make Educational Content</li>
<li>Teaching With Virtual Avatars</li>
<li>New Opportunities For Arts Students</li>
<li>Personalized Learning Experience</li>
<li>Inclusive Education</li>
<li>Student Support</li>
<li>Intelligent Tutoring</li>
<li>AI Agents Integration</li>
</ul>


<h3>Comments</h3>


<p>All of these trends could impact web development instruction, depending on the requirements of the institution.</p> 

<p>Web development itself, as a branch of software development, is likely to rely largely on generative AI going into the future, especially with respect to AI agent integration.</p>

<p>That means to instruct web developers effectively, a web development instructor must understand and be able to use generative AI in both teaching and developing websites.</p> 

<p>To repeat: one way or another an instructor has to learn to integrate a generative AI agent into a web development pipeline, so that he/she can teach it.</p>

<p>While using generative AI to make educational content is optional, it's definitely an intelligent consideration.</p>

<p>Personally, I already use generative AI. For example, I used generative AI to find the article I posted above and summarize aspects of AI in education.</p>

<p>[Though I didn't use the summaries AI generated, since the article above had in my opinion better summaries.]</p>
 
<p>Also, I'm currently attempting to take multiple courses in generative AI and machine learning while taking the Provincial Instructor's Diploma.</p>

<p>The downside of AI in education is that learning it is yet another workload on instructors, on top of the work it took them to master web development to the extent they can teach it in the first place.</p>

<p>The upside of AI in education is that it should be boost productivity, making it possible for instructors and students to do more and learn more in similar time frames.</p>

<summary class="level_2">Learning Partner Call [PIDP 3100] - Exercise 4 Part 3 &nbsp;+</summary>

<h3 style="text-align:left;width:100%;">A Discussion on Education, AI, and Digital Media</h3>

<p>I caught up with my learning partner early in the afternoon on a cold Wednesday in February of 2025.</p>

<p>Outside, there was a lot of snow on the ground, and ice. Vancouver gets cold, some winters. This apparently was one of them.</p> 

<p>I did everything I could to get the lighting right on the camera.</p>

<p>Not bad, actually, but it is time for me to upgrade the tech stack I'm using for Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I clicked on the Zoom link. A few minutes later Filipe started the meeting.</p>

<p>No camera.</p>

<p>After some introductory conversation, Filipe let me know what he does.</p>

<p>He's an instructor of business studies, who teaches business strategy as well as entrepreunership.</p>

<p>I let him know I'm a web development specialists pursuing, along with the instructor certification, which was the reason him and I were speaking, various projects in the digital media space, like Reading World Magazine, for example.</p>

<p>We began to speak along some preplanned meeting points. We were to discuss trends in adult education, as well as our own personal areas of expertise.</p> 

<p>Our conversation went on longer than I expected. There is a lot going on in the field of education, in business, and in web development.</p>

<p>I got a sense immediately of Filipe's passion for his subject matter, and of what appears to be a key trend in education today, which sounds like an institutional level movement to ensure offerings from the education sector are unique in value from freely available, and often high-quality, digital media.</p>

<p>His schools are working hard to stay relevant in the era of global, free, quality education.</p>

<p>I thought about the numbers. Are college enrollments falling? Is the education sector in a dip?</p>

<p>Oh, how I'd love to see the numbers.</p>

<p>He started talking about solutions and brought me back to attention quickly.</p>

<p>Filipe mentioned several strategies his schools are implementing to address the modern relevance of a college education.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;width:100%;">Strategies School's Are Implementing to Stay Relevant.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fewer lectures [40 minutes]</li>
<li>Case scenarios</li>
<li>Group Discussions</li>
<li>Ensuring student's are putting into practice what they're learning.</li>
<li>Institutional connections with employers (visits from recruiters and specialists)</li>
</ul>

<p>It all sounded like more social cognitivism, which may not be a bad thing.</p>

<p>The historical reality is that a college education predicts higher income, and while the story has always been it's the skills that drive upward financial mobility, in business schools at least, there has always been an emphasis on the importance of social networks. The traditional work place is still a place of 'work tribes'. Where you went to school matters, as does having the shared experience of a college education.</p>

<p>What Filipe was describing sounded like a movement to ensure higher-education continues to deliver more of what free digital media can't: social cognitivism.</p>

<p>Here is not the place for me to write fully about the trend in education Filipe spoke of, but if you're reading this, I encourage you to think about the place of formal education in society, and how that place will change or adapt.</p>

<p>Filipe also spoke about a trend in business strategy, particularily in Canada, which is that Canadian firms are now experiencing the social economic consequence of enhanced political tension along the international supply lines, particularily between Canada and the U.S.</p>

<p>It's no longer a theoretical case study. It's the real thing.</p>

<p>Filipe emphasized social implications of trade tensions (potential tariffs), for example, how hiring could be impacted as well as a 'buy-Canadian' trend, if the outcomes of Canada/US trade negotiations lead to tariffs.</p>

<p>As an economics major, I thought about the more usual model, which is a price driven reduction in cross-border trade, decimating some sectors and businesses and reviving others.</p>

<p>It was good to get Filipe's perspective.</p>

<p>For my part, I discussed the rise of artificial intelligence in education, particularly with respect to ways it could be used to improve curriculum writing, and how important it is to ensure students are taught how to use it intelligently in the context of the speciality they're pursuing.</p>

<p>Filipe commented on a concern in the education sector about how student's are using AI to potentially, if I understand correctly, cheat on scores. As someone who thinks about the value an indivual brings to the table, that's not something I would have thought of.</p>

<p>That's another reason I enjoyed the conversation.</p>

<p>I spoke also about the importance of AI in web development. Specifically, how implementing AI in dev-ops pipelines, as a tool manager, to streamline automations and reduced workloads on web developers, is critically important.</p>

<p>To the extent, in fact, that I view a hands on education in AI as a tool manager, as a mandetory part of web development instruction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my conversation with Filipe was insightful and useful, in terms of better understanding trends in adult education.</p>

<p>I got a sense of not exactly concern, but certainly awareness, among teachers about potential job loss from the impact of digital media, and AI, on the teaching sector, which is not something I would have thought about on my own.</p>

<p>I always enjoy discussions that explore new opportunities for education, theory, perspectives, and analysis of current events.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure discussing these subjects with Filipe.</p>

<div>
<p>The class was one week in duration. Eleven of us joined together in classroom with an instructor who taught us concepts around creating lesson plans, engaging learners, and delivering instruction.</p>

<p>Each of us prepared three ten minute lessons. On three of the days, we delivered those lessons and gave written and verbal feedback to the presenting instructor.</p>

<p>We prepared lesson plans for our lessons and graded each other how our lesson delivery matched up against the concepts we learned, and concept grounded activities we engaged in throughout the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Finally, we wrote reflections on our performances, to give ourselves things to work on going forward.</p>

<p>Here is a link to slides on the teaching concepts we covered in the class:</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>And here is their anonymous feedback:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Took off sweatshirt to reveal HTML 5 shirt. High energy. Clearly excited and knowledgeable about the topic. A little too in your own head"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Maybe less info. Great powerpoint. Lots of info. Review tips."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Didn't like about the lesson: Simply - focus on one thing vs too many. Know your audience - that adult learners attention span is low / know what our goals might be. Suggestions: Allow vs to go through content through chunk and flow. Use a timer to hlep you stay on time. Integrate."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Very clear objective in the beginning. List 4 HTML tags. I think I would have suggested sharing the types of HTML tags gather and then reinforced that in the post."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Positive attitude. When the slides a little too quickly. So it was hard to follow along. I learned some new things."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 'CSS' - Cascading style sheets. The clothing of the structure: good sample 'Reading World Mag'. You NEED to venture out of your comfort zone!! Pick simpler topics, not related to computers!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I think I would be able to retain more if the materials were presented slower. Have paper ready for learners. Don't skip through content or say 'don't want to bore you' or say 'out of time'. I observed a very energetic and passionate presenter. Clearer explanations of instructions and steps."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Remember to target your audiences level of knowledge. Learn to offset your colors against your background. Powerpoint will be a great tool for you to use to engage your learners."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"I might slow down my pace next time. I had fun thinking about my logo! I might also keep the slides consistent by keep on line only on each page."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - CSS - 3 Characteristics of CSS. I can tell that this is a subject that the instructor is very passionate and knowledgable. It is a lot of information presented and I would suggest the chunk and chew method to have a bit more practice for the learners to digest the new information to display to instructor. Maybe provide examples of teh characteristics that learners can relate too. It started off really well with the skeleton/HTML + the clothing/CSS"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - HTML - The preparation is evident in the magnitude of the knowledge and confidence in the knowledge. Much of the keywords was were code or in abbreviated form that made it harder to connect to the context."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Recalling yesterday's knowledge is useful. Drawing on previous learners topic is a nice touch. Your speech and tone were more natural and authentic with each lesson. I might pick a topic and start from common sense to ease into the more technical domain."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I felt confused during the presentation. There were slides skipped and the content was delivered too fast for me to keep up. I was unsure how I was to create the logo. I felt the presentation was not prepared. Pen, Paper, Slides - not organized."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Uses negative tone 'I won't bother you with that', don't. I am unsure wthat the 7 steps were. I didn't find a recieved help on my logo design."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Pick one thing that interests them. Be curious, it's about them not you. It's about them, not you. Use open-ended questions (5 - w's - who, went, where, when, why)"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - You were talking about CSS before defining it, maybe do that first. It was hard to follow along, there was a lot of information provided. Good questions for Quiz. You can tell you are passionate about the topic."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Bridge - last class, website you built. O - 3 characteristics of CSS, Pre-assessment - 0. Present - good slides with images, lots of effort. Nice to tie back to the lesson half way through. Keep an eye on time, post assessment. You love for this is clear "
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 16 min 31 secs. CSS - darkmode, hover, structural webpage, clothing for HTML. BOPPPPS, B: website, O: stated learn 4 selectors. P: asked if we know what rules based. P: what are CSS selectors - example. P: question, P: X, S: summarized. Passionate, knowledgeable about subject. Help learners learn, visuals. Like about lesson: Visuals, gave us options for resources - go to library. Quiz questions to reinforce knowledge. Motivate vs trying to make it more fun and confident. Selector: ID Selector, Class Selector, Psuedo class, CSS syntax"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - a very energetic and positive. Slow down on your slides, I didn't get that there were 7 steps. Some parameters and design with a few metrics would have [looks like 'love' not 'have', the 'h' is like an 'l', the 'a' is like an 'o'] helped [looks like 'helpe' not 'helped', the 'd' is like a sideways fish or infinity symbol with a squiggle through it to half cross it out]."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I like how you used Analogy to explain how CSS is different from HTML. Good use of pictures for explanation. Moving a bit quickly through the slides. Maybe give the students time to process the information."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"The instructor's lesson may have been a bit advanced fro the audience. Try to find ways to  draw the learners in using props or activities. Difficult to see the key concepts"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - review with the class. Makes sure we know, what was missing."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 'post-assessment', Objective: HTML usages. 4 HTML tags - header, doctype, 'html', '/html'. Blow up Visuals!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - #4 Pre Assessment. Asked who knew HTML. It didn't hit all learners. 0 intro self"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Lots of info! Try to streamline it for next lesson ... Keep it simple! Look more directly to your students. Hands in pockets ... try to avoid it!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - lots of information given in slides. I like the topic and feel it would work well with more time and practice. For next presentation I would suggest a step by step approach."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Design a logo. A bit too fast going through the slides. I liked the idea of the background when getting into the topic. Enjoyed the time with share each other's design. Suggest more visuals or provide a sample of your own logos to start."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"The objective is clear which is to list 4 tags. And the practice is aligned with the goals. Walking around to check our progress might be better."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - You are clearly very passionate about the topic. But the material was too advanced and hard to understand. You could do a whole lesson on CSS background cover vs contain. How that one thing works w/ a visual. One suggestions, use a remote [clicker]. When you go up to the laptop you have a tendency to read off the screen rather than engaging with the learners. Also, consider working backwards from QUIZ + only covering material that we need. Selectors was bulk [looks like 'hulk'] of lesson, but not on the quiz"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Have materials students need on hand/hand out ahead of lesson. I would have liked it if you  took more time w/ each of the tips/. Removes slides that aren't necessary. WOuld have like more theory + tips instead of designing one."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - CSS. I like your pace and cadence. The practical side of CSS in action was a nice piece of information to start. Still a bit of industry lingo but this time was in contetx and easier to follow along. Missed pre-assessment (unless the rules based language was, but it was not direct enough)."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Needs to get out of comfort zone. Step away from powerpoint. I did not know the extra info of Mr. Lee. Too high level, I did not understand. Read off Powerpoint. I am unsure of the purpose of a tag. Very passionate about the topic. I would have liked to see the picture overview as the main slide. Overall students were confused during discussion."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Thoughts: What is CSS? would have to to see sooner. Skipped through some slides. We try not to say 'No' when responding to students. I would try 'not quite' or 'good suggestion' to soften the response. Very clear process this time. The question I had in my head were answered a little later in your presentation. Is a selector a CSS class? I would have liked to see the 6 selectors in one slide to compare. I would have liked to read the 'why' of each selector on the power point"
</div>

<h3>Additional Notes About My Presentations</h3>

<p>Personally, I wasn't happy with any of my presentations. My confidence was at its highest in my first presentation; however, I didn't quite get to the calmness, or monotonish tones I was looking for.</p>
<p>My second presentation was in my opinion the worst. There was a natural harmony to the conversations in the classroom, a kind of symphony of sound (okay, it was more like a symphony of chatter and chirping), and I didn't feel the 'notes' I was playing harmonized as well as they could have with the others. In general, I have been disastisfied with my voice lately, which is why I have been taking voice therapy.</p>
<p>In my third presentation, I defaulted to a voice I used on the video presentations you can find on Build Hello here: <a href="https://buildhello.ca/blog/2021-11-19-what-is-above-the-fold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://buildhello.ca/blog/2021-11-19-what-is-above-the-fold/</a>. Everybody liked that voice, and gave me better reviews for that lesson. However, to be honest, that voice is a little too 'how to put on the oxygen mask on an airplane' for me, but it seems to work for teaching basic material.</p>

<p>The take away for me was that I have to continue putting my effort into working on voice development and conversational delivery. Over the last 14 years I've put most of my energy into learning computer programming, web development, data science, and economics; and I've been successful at achieving some mastery at that. However, for the most part during that time I was not developing the group skills that are critical to taking a project to the next level. Fortunately, I now have a better perspective of where I can improve, as well as some material I can use to improve with. I'm confident if I put in any where near to the kind of effort and attention I put into computer programming, it won't be long before I improve on my communication skills.</p>

<summary class="level_2">Overview [PIDP 3300] &nbsp;+</summary>
<div>
<p>The class was 8 weeks in duration. The assignments were called activities, emphasizing principles of self-directing learning.</p>

<p>This gave the impression of it being easy, but there was a presentation at the end, that could be considered difficult, based on the level of quality the student wanted to achieve.</p>

<p>I looked through the presentations from other students, and decided on a level of quality, which I think I more or less achieved, though there is always room for improvement.</p>

<p>The first activity was a Zoom or phone call with the instructor, which set the pace for the other 3 activities.</p>

<p>The second activity was an 'ORID' reflection, which is a format for reflections that goes like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Objective</li>
<li>Reflective</li>
<li>Interpretive</li>
<li>Decisional</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is my ORID reflection: <a href="https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/pidp/learning_with_adult_brain_in_mind/pidp_3300_activity_2.pdf"  rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/pidp/learning_with_adult_brain_in_mind/pidp_3300_activity_2.pdf</a></p>

<p>The third activity was to attend another student's presentation, which was easy enough, as there were many students.</p>

<p>The final activity was a presentation, which is detailed in the next section.</p>

<p>The 8 week timeline was nice, since most of the students keep a busy schedule.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<h4>Content Reflection</h4>

<p style="width:100%;"> <b>a.</b> One thing I learned from my topic:<br><br>
 
I learned that the potential for unique thoughts is astronomical large.  <br><br>

<b>b.</b> What I will be doing differently:<br><br>

I combined a lot of information into one presentation. I'd like to experiment with more narrowly focused presentations. I could have pulled flow-state out into its own presentation.<br><br>  

<b>c.</b> Most Informative Resource and Why:<br><br>

I found Shaffer et al. 2003 the most informative resource. They provide a lot of techniques and strategies that apply to curriculum development. 
My favorite resources, however, were Steven Kotler's YouTube videos. He presents in a way that keeps people watching, is always good.<br><br>
</p>

<h4>Presentation/Technical Reflection</h4>

<p style="width:100%;">

<b>a.</b> Something I was proud of:<br><br>

I was proud that I've learned to generate slides directly from notes, using reveal.js and emacs org-mode.<br><br> 

<b>b.</b> One thing I would do differently:<br><br>

I'm focusing now on speech therapy and voice development. I generated a YouTube transcript and counted verbal mistakes and extra words. I said 'so' 87 times and 'uh' 100 times in the video, which is a bad habit.<br><br> 

I created videos of myself repeating Roger Peng, a data scientist from John Hopkins, and Simon Sinek, the public speaker. They are both world class speakers, but still, the video of my presentation doesn't sound as smooth.<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RZAbLhF6k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RZAbLhF6k</a> [Roger Peng]<br><br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ZBcx30cxM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44ZBcx30cxM</a> [Simon Sinek]<br><br>


I'd like to speak more slowly in the future to remove extra words and create more coherency and verbal melody. I can work on increasing the speed later.<br><br>

<b>c.</b> What I learned about making a presentation:<br><br>

I learned that practicing a presentation more thoroughly in advance will create more opportunities for impromptu presentation, and space to discuss with audiences. You could then remove text from the presentation, and rely on bullet points to trigger conversation points<br><br>

And we're going to start the presentation for optimizing curriculum for cognitive load.<br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> it's March 29th 2025, just past, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span>, 3:30 p.m., and today we're going to be talking about optimizing curriculum for cognitive load. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">1</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">1</span><br><br>

In the background you can see an image of an electrified brain. That is something we're going to talk about as well, cognitive overload.<br><br>

Before we start, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span>, VCC, the provider for this course, is located on the unseated and incestral territories of the musam Squamish and slay tooth Nations, which have been stewarded by them since time in Memorial. I'm grateful for the opportunity to take this course on these territories. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">1</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">2</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> my name is Yuri trices. I'm a Canadian from Lithuanian and African-American descent. I'm a web developer, researcher and consultant. I come from a varied educational background having studied formal Sciences, History, Literature, economics and during the last 12 years, the Computer Sciences. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">1</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">3</span><br><br>

Today I'm going to talk about cognitive load Theory, a topic you may know about already given the context of this presentation, but we're going to talk about it alongside the concept of flow or Flow State, and ultimately along with flow, curriculum development and the Computer Sciences.<br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> you can see an image here of hyperdrive. it's an image that you might expect to see in an animation of Star Wars, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">or something like that</span>, and this is an image that really signifies going into the Flow State. You're going to see this image again later in the presentation, when I talk a little bit more about Flow State. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">2</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">3</span><br><br>

First we're going to talk about some of the facts <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">of</span> the brain because we are talking about cognitive load Theory and cognitive loading, and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> cognitive development in general. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">2</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">4</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> facts about the brain, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> 6,000 200 thoughts go through the brain on any given day. You might find numbers like 60,000 or 70,000 if you ask AI how many thoughts go through your head in the day and it really depends on how you categorize a thought. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> This research from saying and pomping in 2020, they categorize thoughts in <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">'sort of like'</span> threads, they call them thought worms, and they come up with probably the most sophisticated measurement of thoughts, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;"><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">Uh</span> current sophisticated measure of thoughts,</span> of about 6,000 thoughts per day. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">4</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">6</span> <br><br>

Short-term memory seven pieces of info can be stored in your short-term memory at once on average, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> and held in short-term memory for about 20 seconds, and the average brain has about 200, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> 2.5 million gigabytes of memory, if you've got let's say 1,000 or 2,000 gigs on your computer, you can imagine how much you can store in a brain that has 2.5 million gigabytes of long-term storage. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">4</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">8</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> 86 billion neurons in the brain and more than 125 trillion synaptic connections. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you can,</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> a lot of times people talk about the number of neurons and the number of synaptic Connections in the context of the Milky Way. 
The Milky Way has hundreds of billions of stars and so we tend to think of the brain <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">'kind of'</span> as large as The Milky Way. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">the re uh.</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">6</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">10</span><br><br>

You might want to look into those numbers <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a little bit</span> more, but the reality is that when we have one ".2" 125 trillion synaptic connections and 86 billion neurons and each neuron can have up to 10,000 connections. <br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> if you think in terms of a probabilistic <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> combinatorials, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you can have as U</span>, and each different combination is a different thought, you can have as many different thoughts as there are atoms in the known universe. The number is absolutely astronomical in terms of how many unique thoughts you can have. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">7</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">11</span> <br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">the the</span> brain makes up about 2% of the body's weight and it uses up about 20% of total caloric intake. one of the reasons is that the brain is electrified. Neurons have axons and dendrites and they've got an electric current that goes through the neuron and then chemical synapses that pass that current <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> between different neurons. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">8</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">12</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you can see this is an image of the brain and this electrical current that travels through the neurons <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">is what</span> causes this huge caloric intake, 20% of the total caloric intake, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> what is cognitive load Theory? <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">10</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">12</span> <br><br>


Cognitive load theory is a way that we can talk about the brain and how we work with the brain using terminology. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">We've got</span> intrinsic, extraneous, and germine <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">are the types of</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> are three words that we use when we're talking about cognitive load.
<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">10</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">13</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> intrinsic, as you can see up here, is the complexity of new information, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">and here we're talking about ...</span> if you wanted to have a phone call with someone and you wanted to say <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">some</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> particular points but you didn't want to read from a script, you might study for 5 10 minutes before you make that phone call, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> that you have all of the information stored in your mind before you make that phone call.
<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">12</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">14</span><br><br>


What you would have done is just loaded up your intrinsic cognitive load, that would be the things that you wanted to say on the phone. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">reword</span> <br><br>

Extraneous cognitive load is the load that comes from external sources. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">the</span> could be bad lighting, it could be people talking, it could be distractions, it could be a <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> poorly written textbook or a poorly designed handout. <br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">now</span> Germain is how we describe the process of formulating memories. the process of taking information and turning it into longterm storage, or short-term storage.This is created by creating schemas.<br><br> 

It takes information and it organizes <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">that information</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">I've uh</span> we're going to talk <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a little bit</span> more about each one of these again <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">13</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">15</span><br><br> 


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> intrinsic cognitive load, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">just to repeat it</span>, refers to the inherent complexity of a task or information being learned. it's determined by the number of interacting elements that must be processed simultaneously. for example working on a complex computer science program might involve understanding complex directory structures, build pipelines tooling chain switches and conditions and multiple programs each with many variables and values as well as other varied aspects of the problem space that work together to generate a programs output. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">14</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">15</span><br><br> 

intrinsic cognitive load is important <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> in terms of Computer Sciences, when we're talking about cognitive loading and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> cognitive load and designing curriculum for both of those <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> different types of cognitive load extraneous. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">14</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">18</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">Co</span> cognitive load refers to the mental effort caused by unnecessary or distracting elements. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">we're talking about</span> noise threats social activities visually confusing elements in the environment, like lighting <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">and ...</span><br><br> 

Germaine cognitive load, again <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">here we're talking about</span> encoding knowledge into long-term memory, which includes identifying it categorizing it and then encoding it the brain is creating new synaptic connections between neurons and more broadly between neural networks. <br><br>

The cognitive load threshold <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> cognitive load threshold, it's not on this chart, but a cognitive load threshold is a theoretical threshold that identifies the difference between <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">cognitive load</span>, normal cognitive load and cognitive overload. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">15</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">18</span><br><br> 

It's theore iCal because it can't be identified in any precise way, but we can presume it to be different for every individual and also for individuals across different circumstances. What we can say is that when the cognitive load of Any Given individual passes their cognitive load threshold they become cognitively overloaded.<br><br> 

Now we're going to talk <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a bit</span> about the overloaded brain, and then we're going to talk about <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">this</span> concept <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">called</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> Flow State, and then we're going to talk about <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">more about</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> designing curriculum for cognitive loading and cognitive load. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">15</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">20</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">So</span> the overloaded brain <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> Bernan Cox and several other researchers in 2013 published breaking the camels back can cognitive overload be Quantified in the human brain. their research looks for a precise difference between cognitive load and cognitive overload they tested subjects with strip tasks under different levels of cognitive load and distraction, such as audio stimulus, while scanning their brains with a neuros scanner. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">17</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">20</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">they</span> then used statistical methods such as fouryear Transformations and paired T tests to measure air rates and reaction times while their sample size was small, their results suggested performance decrements of up to 56% for error rates and 81% for reaction times. they were not successful in identifying what we <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> could call a precise cognitive load threshold, or devising a unit of cognitive load, but they did find localized areas in the brain that were visible when scanned as the brain moved from normal to overloaded cognitive load. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">17</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">21</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> we're not going to go into detail about where cognitive load shows up in the brain, but it is helpful to remember that an overloaded brain can have <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">5</span> 56% <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">and</span> or higher error rates and 81% slower reaction times.<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">18</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">21</span><br><br> 


Another research paper by seall Santos anos solivan in 20120 titled how do attending physicians describe cognitive overload among workplace Learners give some insights into how to recognize cognitive load in students <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> they conducted a secondary quality analysis of transcripts of interviews among Health Healthcare workplace teachers to identify signs of cognitive load. Their results are helpful in spotting cognitive overload in students. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">19</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">21</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> if your students <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> have poor performance on workplace tasks students, are workers, nonverbal physical manifestations, this could be not so dextrous making <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> behavioral mistakes, verbal utterances <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> they could be swearing, they could be mumbling, they could be talking to themselves, they could be groaning. nonoptimal interpersonal interactions. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> this is any anywhere from bickering to just not really creating strong workplace interactions or Schoo yard interaction. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">21</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">24</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> things just aren't going well you can tell <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">maybe</span> that they're cognitively overloaded. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">22</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><br><br>

there's another paper <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">that</span> I will put in the references, that I didn't get a chance to read, but they were looking at cognitive load <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">on</span> manufacturing and they had some deeper insights into how to recognize cognitive load. some of the things that they mentioned is that <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> people that are under high cognitive load or cognitive overload might have dilated pupils, their eyes might get wider and also they might blink a lot more. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">22</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">okay</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> now we're going to talk about the Flow State. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">23</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> cognitive load or cognitive overload is what happens when your brain is overloaded and you are not performing well. You're making mistakes, you're <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> fatigued, your relationships are suffering, and you're not very responsive. you're not picking things up <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">very</span> quickly. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">24</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">26</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> Stephen Cotler author of the rise of Supermen decoding the science of ultimate Human Performance describes a flow State as an optimal State of Consciousness where individual feel and perform their best. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">27</span><br><br> 

it's <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">kind of</span> the opposite of cognitive overload <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span>, in this state people experience moments of wrapped attention and total absorption becoming so focused on the task at hand that everything else disappears. action and awareness merge and the sense of self vanishes. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">28</span><br><br> 

signs you might be in a state of flow, this is from <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">she she she sent me high high ali uh she sent me ha uh from 1990 miali she sent me</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">29</span><br><br> 

Challenge skills balance is the number one sign you might be in a <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">in a</span> state of flow, I don't think these are ordinal. This means if you <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> are challenged you've got the skills to meet those challenges. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">30</span><br><br>


Total concentration you're totally absorbed in the task clear goals you understand what you want to achieve immediate feedback you're in the zone you're getting feedback from your actions from your words from your behaviors, from <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">your</span> everything <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">that</span> you're doing is responsive to you transformation of time time disappears<br><br> 

feeling intrinsically rewarded <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> this has been related to addiction when you're in a state of flow it becomes addicting you can think of highspeed skiers you can think of high performing athletes gymnasts also computer programmers you're doing so well it's rewarding you. you feel good. you want to do it more. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">31</span><br><br> 

effortlessness effortlessness effort <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's just</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> Things Are going well. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">32</span><br><br>


loss of self-consciousness you're <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> not self really aware you're not really self-conscious you're in the zone you're focused on what you're doing and you have a feeling of total control <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">25</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">33</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> a well-known study by Cranston and Keller from 2013, this is a McKenzie study, showed that people in Flow State reported increasing their productivity by 500%. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">26</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">34</span><br><br> 


Other benefits of being in the state of flow described by stepen Cotler include higher intrinsic motivation enhanced pattern recognition really good for programming you're able to pick things up. you can <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you can</span> look at the the data, you can understand the data. heighten senses more information <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">PRP</span> process per second creativity increases 500 to 700% learning speed increases from 240 to 500% heightened problem solving abilities<br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> as you can see the flow state is the opposite of being cognitively overloaded 
if you're in Flow State you're in the zone and you're learning twice as fast your creativity increases you're five times as <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">more</span> productive and your problem solving goes up <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">27</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">34</span><br><br> 


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> flow is a big deal in computer programming which is a high cognitive load activity again according to Cotler flow requires a 4% higher level of difficulty than you're accustomed to to push the body into Flow State computer programming is difficult you're almost always doing things that are a little bit harder than you know how to do, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you're <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">constantly in the Flow State</span> you're constantly learning.  <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">28</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">35</span><br><br>

Joel spoki <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> one of the ERS of stack Overflow once said productivity depends on being able to juggle a lot of little details in short-term memory all at once any kind of interruption can cause these details to come crashing down when you resume work you can't remember any of the details like local variable names <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">variable names</span> that you were using or where you were up to in implementing that search algorithm and you have to keep looking these things up which slows you down a lot until you get back up to speed <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">28</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">36</span><br><br> 


B pop popper <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> at stack Overflow wrote an article in 2018 titled developer flow state and its impact on productiv <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> productivity, and he's really following up on what Joel spoki was saying about how easy it is for a developer to get knocked out of Flow State <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">28</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">38</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> workers experience 87 interruptions per day these are not specifically computer programming workers but these are <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">just</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">regular</span> workers that are <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">just</span> 
<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">29</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">38</span><br><br>

interrupted programmers take 10 to 15 minutes to start editing code after an interruption<br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;"> so</span> one uninterrupted 2-hour coding session per day is pretty much the best that a coder is expected to get on average. now if you are a 10x coder, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you're</span> you're going to be boosting that <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> up to 10 12 maybe even 20 hours <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> per day you're really going to find a way of <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> working uninterrupted <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">30</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">41</span><br><br>


The average roadblock costs more than 40 minutes to resolve, taking you out of the developer Flow State. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> it's really about Focus concentration,  and not being distracted <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> rise of Sally <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">in</span> in 2020 introduces 22 known flow flow State triggers and I just wanted to mention that <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> the flow state is not exactly the opposite of being cognitively overloaded. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> if you're cognitively overloaded you're not performing well and you're making mistakes but if you're not cognitive overloaded <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">cognitively overloaded</span> it doesn't mean you're in the Flow State, and you do want to get in the Flow State, but this lesson is not about how to get into the Flow State, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> it is important as a computer programmer. But when we're talking about curriculum design, we're really <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;"></span> about <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">and</span> Computer Sciences, we're really talking about creating the conditions where the flow state <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">is</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> can occur. It's easier to get into the flow state if you follow some rules of thumb, and and we're going to look at some possibilities there. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">32</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">45</span><br><br> 


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> here I want to draw the distinction between cognitive load and cognitive loading remember I used that example of <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> a telep call you want to communicate <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">some information</span> on the telephone call and you don't want to read from a script while you're on the phone, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you take five 10 minutes before the call to read the information <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> that you have fresh in your mind the information that you want to communicate on the call. what you've just done is <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you've done</span> cognitive loading <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> you've put information into your brain, you can see you started you had no information and before the phone call you loaded up and now you've got that information <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> cognitive load is intrinsic extraneous and gerine cognitive loading is getting from nothing to Intrinsic, and it does involve some germine activity because you're going to be taking <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">some</span> information out of long-term storage, as well and loading it into intrinsic memory. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">35</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">48</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> in computer science and web development it's about loading the problem space and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> we're going to <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">talk talk</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a bit</span> about the problem space <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> but what we can say about the problem space if you are a web developer the problem space is probably a lot more than just the problem that you're working on, it's also the directory the directory structure and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">the the</span> code base, as it were, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> in my case, when I first started programming heavily, around 12 years ago, it would take anywhere from 2 to four hours to get into the Zone, today after more than a decade focused on optimizing workflow for Flow State, it can still take me an hour to an hour and a half to get from cognitive loading to intrinsically loading, though that number comes down if I stay on a specific problem and come back to it across multiple days. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">37</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">50</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> here are some intrinsic ways I make that happen. one know the code base the code base is complex it's a directory it's a repository it's a <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">bunch</span> of tools you need to know that code base. it's <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> important to computer programming to know the codebase that there are a lot of programming jobs that are code based specific somebody learns the codebase they learn <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> how the codebase works it might be a really massive codebase, could be a piece of software for let's say Microsoft teams ,it could be a video game. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> once they know the codebase a lot of their job is working in that codebase. you can't just take someone new and put them into that codebase, because it's just going to take them too long to learn the codebase. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">40</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">50</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> knowing the codebase is a big part of being able to get into the flow state, to get into the zone and to reduce cognitive loading <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> keep a log book documented coding sessions. keeping a log book helps you pick up where you left off. know your Advan sdks software development toolkits your servers compilers lters apis how everything works within the scripts uh package managers <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span>, again it's knowing that code base. know your customiz developer tools and environments your text editor proficiency <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> and this is <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">also a</span>  <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">41</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">53</span><br><br>

know documentation for custom features. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> if you've created the codebase there's going to be a lot of custom features, but you're still going to have to remember those in order to get from <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> starting the day to working and then AI in the SDK this is kind of like <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> knowing your custom customized developer tools but you could also use AI to help you load up, and then your custom snippet, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> it's <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span> how everything works. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> when you start your <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">your</span> day coding your text editor might have a button on it that brings you back to where you were the <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">next</span> day. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">44</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">54</span><br><br> 

But an example of how that 1 hour or that 1.5 hours to get from cognitive loading to intrinsically loaded <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">what loaded</span> what might happen is you might have to set up your development server <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> you might have to check <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> the git repo and make sure that you've done some pull to ensure that you have the latest <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">features</span> there might be a conflict in <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">that</span> get repo so you want to reduce any conflicts, resolve those conflicts, and then you want to <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> look at what you <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">are</span> doing the day before. you're going to want to open up the different panels if you have any extra software that you have to work with you're going to open up <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">all</span> that software get everything started, find the code that you were working on and then set up a kind of a system <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> that you can work from one document to the other and produce your code. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">45</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">57</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> your productivity takes some time to Prime and that is a hugely expensive process. it can take a lot of energy just to get to the point where you start to code, let alone to the point where you get into Flow State. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> it's a very important subject <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">very</span> important part of Computer Sciences and of web development <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">47</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">58</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> now we're going to talk about optimizing curriculum, but when we're talking about optimizing curriculum for Flow State, minimal cognitive load, and minimal cognitive loading, we're talking about extraneous load. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> changes we can make to the structure of classes and problem sets and to the environment that enable students to get into flow, stay focused, and optimize for low cognitive load. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">49</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">58</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> let's talk about those two things in the next few slides and then we will wrap up. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">50</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">58</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> optimizing curriculum for cognitive load.<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">51</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">58</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> Weinstein at all in their 2018 paper teaching the science of learning introduced six characteristic processes of cognitive learning theory that will be helpful in conceptualizing how we can write curricula for cognitive load. they are: spaced practice, which is offsetting quizzes and assignments, and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">what this is about is</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> repeatedly introducing <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">introducing information</span> and then introducing it again <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> spaced out across time <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">time</span> periods <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> the more you revisit <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">that</span> that material, the more you're going to make those connections between neurons and neural networks and the more <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">likely</span> you're going to be able to bring that information back with you <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">need it</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">52</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">62</span><br><br> 

interleaving is switching between problem types and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">and</span> subjects and interleaving <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> you can think of it as, you're working on <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> a looping problem and then maybe you're working on an objectoriented problem and then you're going to go into a functional Paradigm. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">this</span> that would be a big switch between interleading <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> I actually think that it's better to stay in one problem type <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">but switching through</span> because switching <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">from</span> problem types require extra cognitive loading and extra energy, but it could be helpful in the case where you wanted to highlight the specifics of one particular problem type. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">52</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">64</span><br><br> 

when we're talking about interleaving between subjects, and this is what we're going to look at for cognitive loading, it's something that for web development I don't particularly <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> emphasize <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">I mean it a lot of</span> it's how it's done in Computer Sciences, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">52</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">65</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> I'm not saying you can't learn using interleaving, but I <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span>, when we're talking about optimizing for cognitive loading, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> interleaving <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">is something,</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">between subjects</span> is something that we're going to want to reduce. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">53</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">67</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> retrieval flash cards again this is kind of like space practice <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">54</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">67</span><br><br> 

elaboration <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you're anchoring things to existing memories, a learning technique <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">55</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">68</span><br><br> 

concrete examples, we're talking about simplifying problems or providing partly solved problems <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> to make the cognitive load lower for the student and dual coding is introducing multiple formats for the same problem by introducing multiple formats, could be text, could be audio, could be visual <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> these are just different ways of kind of attacking the problem from different different angles to create different types of synapses and different types of memories. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">55</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">70</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> schaer at Al in <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> 2003 <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">what I</span> what I consider to be a seminal paper titled applying cognitive load Theory to Computer Science Education, they offer several suggestions to optimize curriculum design for cognitive load. one they partition information into small segments, as chunk and chew, this notion of if you have seven items in your memory then if you have smaller items into memory you can work with those blocks and then build <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> larger components out from the small blocks <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">56</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">72</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> simultaneous presentation of Concepts and procedures, this can be helpful <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> in understanding how concepts are applied if you have a concept and it's kind of <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">a</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> confusing concept <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> we could think of for example in template literals there's template literal strings but then there's template literal functions you might want to see an example of that because it might be a little confusing <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">57</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">74</span><br><br> 

presentation of heuristic approaches and strategies independent of domain reference <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> by heris approaches we're really talking about rules of thumb and by independent independent domain references where in the computer science analogy we would be talking about dependent of a particular language or a particular framework so web development you might be doing something with WordPress you can do something with Hugo and you could do something with let's say node and if you are teaching a particular concept <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> it would be independent of the domain reference <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you teach the concept but it can apply to any one of those different Frameworks and the same could be said for computer programming languages, you could be doing something in Python you could be doing something in C++ you could be doing something in JavaScript <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">59</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">76</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> broad practice and you would do that with suo code actually so broad practice using partially completed examples mentioned that already if the example is partially completed it's <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span> easier for the student, they don't have to load up the entire problem set <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">60</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">76</span><br><br>

a gradual withdrawal of supporting information from practice tasks <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you have a practice task you have a description of the task and it gives you some information, and if you give a lot of information you can reduce that information a <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">decom</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> composition of practice tasks into small steps then gradual integration into a complete skill <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> we could talk about creating a loop here and you might want to introduce <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> the condition within the bracket you might want to introduce how to do an increment you want to increment a variable and then you might want to <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> actual introduce the iterations of the loop <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> looping would be the complete skill and you would be <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">de</span> de composing the components of Any Given Loop across independent domain references <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">63</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">80</span><br><br>


<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> goal-free problem solving the idea here is to <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> keep students learning <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> there might be several different ways of solving a problem and they're going to find the problem that works for them this could be <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> Illustrated if you're thinking of a design class and you're thinking of Designing something like a brochure for example because if you're designing a brochure there's a lot of different ways you can design it <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> the student has the goal you know <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> is not a specific to how you're going to design the brochure, you just design the brochure and there's a lot of ways of doing goal-free problem solving in Computer Sciences, and it's something that <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> you may want to look into <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">66</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">85</span><br><br> 

a careful integration of text and Graphics again this is going back to different sources as is the next bullet point Visual and oral sources for learning we want to ensure that we've got nice Graphics <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">our</span> we want to <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> ensure that our documents look good and we've got a visual and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> oral sources for learning <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> we can really attack that problem from many different points. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">67</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">87</span><br><br>

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> optimizing curriculum for cognitive loading now this is <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> sort of a subset of optimizing for cognitive load <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> here <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">we're we're</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">talking about</span> when we're optimizing for cognitive loading we're talking about minimizing the energy spent loading a problem space into working memory like a web development project and again these three concepts we've got Flow State we've got cognitive loading and then we've got cognitive load and these in terms of optimizing curriculum for the three of these they they may seem like disperate subjects <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> cognitive load is <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">what</span> the load you're carrying cognitive loading is getting that into your mind and then you've got an overloaded mind and then you've got Flow State and so again we're not building curriculum to get people into Flow State but we want to keep Flow State in mind <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> that we create situations where <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> Flow State can be probable. <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">70</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">89</span><br><br>

okay <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> in my personal experience I found the fastest way to gain Proficiency in a particular problem space which includes navigating the problem space recalling features of it and solving problems in it is to work in the space throughout the day I found four consecutive shifts of 8 to 12 hours optimal <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> with two or three days off afterward <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">71</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">90</span><br><br>

in management the rule of thumb is to spend no more than four hours a day on the computer <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">computer</span> managers need to connect with workers they need to stay in the client loop it's a people job but in high productivity coding what is often referred to as 10x coding the trick is to hit it with everything you've got and then go away for a few days to be honest 10xers often turn those <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">10hour shifts</span> four consecutive 10 hour shifts into 20 hour shifts they will just do an incredible amount of work and then they'll stop for a number of days and take time off<br><br>

in my experience Flow State seems to appear after 4 hours on the computer <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> the the rule of thumb for management is no more than four hours a day on a computer but in high productivity coding you don't even get into Flow State till you've been on the computer for four hours, <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> once you've been on the computer for four hours you obviously want to stay on the computer for longer so that you can have five times the productivity you can learn from 240% to 500% faster and you can solve problems <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> better <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> there's all these Flow State reasons why computer programming 10x coding is all about hitting that flow State and <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it does</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">take time</span> you do have to spend time on the computer <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you obviously <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> you want to look at ways to mitigate that across <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">long</span> long <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> periods of times like numbers of days <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">75</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">93</span><br><br> 

stacking blocks <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> one of the most interesting strategies then to optimize in curriculum for minim minimal cognitive loading and optimal flow state is to do the reverse of interleaving and space practice as it applies across sub subjects <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> space practice you <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you</span> probably want to keep doing that <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> let's say you study a subject on Monday night well yeah you should come back and have a quick look at it on Thursday night I'm not saying <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> don't do that but <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">you know</span> if you work on one problem from Monday to Thursday and you put all of your energy into that then space practice might not be as helpful because you might be bumping yourself out of Flow State <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">77</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">93</span><br><br> 

<span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> in the next slide we'll look at a sample student schedule and talk more about optimizing for cognitive loading <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> this is a schedule from Metro nationville Public Schools and you can see there are four blocks and it's from Monday to Friday we've got math and then English and then math and then biology and then lunch and then an elective and then we've got the total time <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> maybe you could increase this time and in a computer science type of environment <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">if we're</span> if we're really talking about optimizing for cognitive loading you might take the <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">ENT</span> all of Monday is working in one problem space so the entire Monday and the entire possibly Wednesday or it could be all of Monday and then all of Tuesday you would work on the one problem set <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you can really get into that problem space and you can stay optimized in that problem space <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">so</span> you might do something like design in the morning and then you might do some exercise and then you might do front end and then you might do databases and then you might do backend but you're working on the same project for the entire day and this is really <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> key because it's a key way of doing things because when we're talking about cognitive <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">um</span> loading we're really talking about <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">uh</span> <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">it's</span> it really takes a lot of energy to do cognitive loading <span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">82</span><span style="background-color:#bbfc20;">96</span><br><br>

<div>


<p>Like most of the courses in this program, Curriculum Development has a lot of papers. It's just back-to-back reading and papers, really a lot of work.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this course the most, however, from all of the courses I've taken so far because writing a curriculum for a web development is interesting.</p>

<p>To be clear, I've written curriculum for web development before. In 2022/2023 I wrote the intermediate to advanced JavaScript modules for a web developmet course delivered by company called Correlation One to Amazon employees across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. As such, I have a pretty solid conceptual understanding of writing curriculum for JavaScript. It was definitely interesting to expand that to a full web development course, even if the only document reflecting the material to be contained in the curriculum to any level of detail is only an outline.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the papers required for PIDP 3210</p>

<ul>
<li>ORID Reflection 1</li>
<li>ORID Reflection 2</li>
<li>Course Profile</li>
<li>Course Outline</li>
<li>Workshop Plan</li>
<li>Alignment Exercise</li>
</ul>


<p>Again, in my case the course outline was the most interesting document, but I can't share it here, since it's the outline for my own course, which reveals some of the insights that should distinguish my course from other courses.</p>

<p>In other words, the outline is paid content, but here are the other papers.</p>

<p><a style="margin:0;word-break:break-word;" href="https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/pidp/3210_curriculum_development/pidp_3210_assignment_1_1_tricys_compressed.pdf"  rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORID Reflection 1</a></p>

<p><a style="margin:0;word-break:break-word;" href="https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/pidp/3210_curriculum_development/pidp_3210_workshop_plan_and_rationale_compressed.pdf"  rel="noopener" target="_blank">Workshop Plan and Rationale</a></p>

<p><a style="margin:0;word-break:break-word;" href="https://xyz-abc-show-and-tell.github.io/pidp/3210_curriculum_development/pidp_3210_alignment_compressed.pdf"  rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alignment Exercise</a></p>


<p>The instructor emphasized the importance of the Course Profile, which is supposed to be the document from which the rest of the course is written; however, in my case I already had the outline more or less written in my mind, which meant I wrote the profile from the outline.</p>

<p>For this reason there were some minor inconsistencies in between the profile and the outline, which it turns is a 'thing' in curriculum development. Hence the alignment exercise, which is a demonstration of how a curriculum writer might go about ensuring alignment across documents.</p>

<p>Since I didn't publish the outline here, if you're going to look at any of those documents, I recommend looking at the Course Profile.</p>

<div>
<p>After the first four months of the PIDP, I've discovered there is a pattern. The PIDP is a lot work, a lot of papers, a lot of reading, a lot of theory.</p>

<p>I should say however, in general, the theory is applicable to teaching, and generally highly useful.</p>

<p>The Instructional Strategies Course has just a ton of tips and tricks for teaching, as well as activities and strategies that can be used in lesson plans. It's really full of great stuff. I can definitely recommend the text book to any teacher of likely any subject. It's definitely a handy go-to handbook made especially for instructors. </p>

<p>You can pick up the latest edition of "Student Engagement Techniques: A Handbook for College Faculty" at any big bookstore, here's a link to the outline of the first edition, which is in the internet archive <a style="margin:0;word-break:break-word;" href="https://archive.org/details/studentengagemen0000bark/page/n5/mode/2up"  rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://archive.org/details/studentengagemen0000bark/page/n5/mode/2up</a> </p>

<p>In general my papers earn good marks, but I do sometimes get docked for chincing on the syntax of the APA references. APA referencing is a bit of an art form. I've had to correct both Llama-4.1-Maverick and Claude Sonnet on API references, though not very often. AI will often return several differently formatted references, in some cases claiming each one is the best one, which really defeats the purpose of asking a machine to format your references. I find the most confusion in inline quote references, which are supposed to include a positional reference, at least when the source is a webpage. Also, the bibliography style webpage reference should have an italicized title, which I sometimes omit since I'm typically generating PDFs from webpages (rather than using LaTeX, which I used to use). Since my webpages are created via export functionality from my documents, I can get a bit lazy. I don't want to bother adding custom html to italicize a title, and rarely use the markdown italicize syntax.</p>

<p>If you're using my papers to give you an example of what you should do, I suggest reading also carefully the rubric and assignment specifications, which tell you everything you need to know. I precreate templates in build pipelines, which means I do set-up ahead of time so that I can create documents more quickly later. If you want to build papers like mine in Word or Google Docs, it could take you a long time. I highly recommend being efficient with your time.</p>
