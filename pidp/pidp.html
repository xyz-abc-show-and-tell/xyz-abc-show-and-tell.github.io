<p style="text-align:left;width:100%;">Trends In Adult Education - AI</p>


<p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education is a significant trend that is reshaping how we learn and teach.</p> 


<p>Click the image below to read an article about AI trends in adult education, written by Serhii Uspenskyi.</p>


<a href="https://springsapps.com/knowledge/main-ai-trends-in-education-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img class="org-image" alt="trends_adult_education.jpg" src="./media/trends_adult_education.jpg" loading="lazy">
</a></br>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Source: https://springsapps.com/knowledge/main-ai-trends-in-education-2024]</p>



<p>Here are some of the key trends mentioned in the post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Generative AI to Make Educational Content</li>
<li>Teaching With Virtual Avatars</li>
<li>New Opportunities For Arts Students</li>
<li>Personalized Learning Experience</li>
<li>Inclusive Education</li>
<li>Student Support</li>
<li>Intelligent Tutoring</li>
<li>AI Agents Integration</li>
</ul>


<h3>Comments</h3>


<p>All of these trends could impact web development instruction, depending on the requirements of the institution.</p> 

<p>Web development itself, as a branch of software development, is likely to rely largely on generative AI going into the future, especially with respect to AI agent integration.</p>

<p>That means to instruct web developers effectively, a web development instructor must understand and be able to use generative AI in both teaching and developing websites.</p> 

<p>To repeat: one way or another an instructor has to learn to integrate a generative AI agent into a web development pipeline, so that he/she can teach it.</p>

<p>While using generative AI to make educational content is optional, it's definitely an intelligent consideration.</p>

<p>Personally, I already use generative AI. For example, I used generative AI to find the article I posted above and summarize aspects of AI in education.</p>

<p>[Though I didn't use the summaries AI generated, since the article above had in my opinion better summaries.]</p>
 
<p>Also, I'm currently attempting to take multiple courses in generative AI and machine learning while taking the Provincial Instructor's Diploma.</p>

<p>The downside of AI in education is that learning it is yet another workload on instructors, on top of the work it took them to master web development to the extent they can teach it in the first place.</p>

<p>The upside of AI in education is that it should be boost productivity, making it possible for instructors and students to do more and learn more in similar time frames.</p>

<summary class="level_2">Learning Partner Call [PIDP 3100] - Exercise 4 Part 3 &nbsp;+</summary>

<h3 style="text-align:left;width:100%;">A Discussion on Education, AI, and Digital Media</h3>

<p>I caught up with my learning partner early in the afternoon on a cold Wednesday in February of 2025.</p>

<p>Outside, there was a lot of snow on the ground, and ice. Vancouver gets cold, some winters. This apparently was one of them.</p> 

<p>I did everything I could to get the lighting right on the camera.</p>

<p>Not bad, actually, but it is time for me to upgrade the tech stack I'm using for Zoom calls.</p>

<p>I clicked on the Zoom link. A few minutes later Filipe started the meeting.</p>

<p>No camera.</p>

<p>After some introductory conversation, Filipe let me know what he does.</p>

<p>He's an instructor of business studies, who teaches business strategy as well as entrepreunership.</p>

<p>I let him know I'm a web development specialists pursuing, along with the instructor certification, which was the reason him and I were speaking, various projects in the digital media space, like Reading World Magazine, for example.</p>

<p>We began to speak along some preplanned meeting points. We were to discuss trends in adult education, as well as our own personal areas of expertise.</p> 

<p>Our conversation went on longer than I expected. There is a lot going on in the field of education, in business, and in web development.</p>

<p>I got a sense immediately of Filipe's passion for his subject matter, and of what appears to be a key trend in education today, which sounds like an institutional level movement to ensure offerings from the education sector are unique in value from freely available, and often high-quality, digital media.</p>

<p>His schools are working hard to stay relevant in the era of global, free, quality education.</p>

<p>I thought about the numbers. Are college enrollments falling? Is the education sector in a dip?</p>

<p>Oh, how I'd love to see the numbers.</p>

<p>He started talking about solutions and brought me back to attention quickly.</p>

<p>Filipe mentioned several strategies his schools are implementing to address the modern relevance of a college education.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;width:100%;">Strategies School's Are Implementing to Stay Relevant.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Fewer lectures [40 minutes]</li>
<li>Case scenarios</li>
<li>Group Discussions</li>
<li>Ensuring student's are putting into practice what they're learning.</li>
<li>Institutional connections with employers (visits from recruiters and specialists)</li>
</ul>

<p>It all sounded like more social cognitivism, which may not be a bad thing.</p>

<p>The historical reality is that a college education predicts higher income, and while the story has always been it's the skills that drive upward financial mobility, in business schools at least, there has always been an emphasis on the importance of social networks. The traditional work place is still a place of 'work tribes'. Where you went to school matters, as does having the shared experience of a college education.</p>

<p>What Filipe was describing sounded like a movement to ensure higher-education continues to deliver more of what free digital media can't: social cognitivism.</p>

<p>Here is not the place for me to write fully about the trend in education Filipe spoke of, but if you're reading this, I encourage you to think about the place of formal education in society, and how that place will change or adapt.</p>

<p>Filipe also spoke about a trend in business strategy, particularily in Canada, which is that Canadian firms are now experiencing the social economic consequence of enhanced political tension along the international supply lines, particularily between Canada and the U.S.</p>

<p>It's no longer a theoretical case study. It's the real thing.</p>

<p>Filipe emphasized social implications of trade tensions (potential tariffs), for example, how hiring could be impacted as well as a 'buy-Canadian' trend, if the outcomes of Canada/US trade negotiations lead to tariffs.</p>

<p>As an economics major, I thought about the more usual model, which is a price driven reduction in cross-border trade, decimating some sectors and businesses and reviving others.</p>

<p>It was good to get Filipe's perspective.</p>

<p>For my part, I discussed the rise of artificial intelligence in education, particularly with respect to ways it could be used to improve curriculum writing, and how important it is to ensure students are taught how to use it intelligently in the context of the speciality they're pursuing.</p>

<p>Filipe commented on a concern in the education sector about how student's are using AI to potentially, if I understand correctly, cheat on scores. As someone who thinks about the value an indivual brings to the table, that's not something I would have thought of.</p>

<p>That's another reason I enjoyed the conversation.</p>

<p>I spoke also about the importance of AI in web development. Specifically, how implementing AI in dev-ops pipelines, as a tool manager, to streamline automations and reduced workloads on web developers, is critically important.</p>

<p>To the extent, in fact, that I view a hands on education in AI as a tool manager, as a mandetory part of web development instruction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, my conversation with Filipe was insightful and useful, in terms of better understanding trends in adult education.</p>

<p>I got a sense of not exactly concern, but certainly awareness, among teachers about potential job loss from the impact of digital media, and AI, on the teaching sector, which is not something I would have thought about on my own.</p>

<p>I always enjoy discussions that explore new opportunities for education, theory, perspectives, and analysis of current events.</p>

<p>It was a real pleasure discussing these subjects with Filipe.</p>

<div>
<p>The class was one week in duration. Eleven of us joined together in classroom with an instructor who taught us concepts around creating lesson plans, engaging learners, and delivering instruction.</p>

<p>Each of us prepared three ten minute lessons. On three of the days, we delivered those lessons and gave written and verbal feedback to the presenting instructor.</p>

<p>We prepared lesson plans for our lessons and graded each other how our lesson delivery matched up against the concepts we learned, and concept grounded activities we engaged in throughout the rest of the week.</p>

<p>Finally, we wrote reflections on our performances, to give ourselves things to work on going forward.</p>

<p>Here is a link to slides on the teaching concepts we covered in the class:</p>

<div>
<p>And here is their anonymous feedback:</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Took off sweatshirt to reveal HTML 5 shirt. High energy. Clearly excited and knowledgeable about the topic. A little too in your own head"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Maybe less info. Great powerpoint. Lots of info. Review tips."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Didn't like about the lesson: Simply - focus on one thing vs too many. Know your audience - that adult learners attention span is low / know what our goals might be. Suggestions: Allow vs to go through content through chunk and flow. Use a timer to hlep you stay on time. Integrate."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Very clear objective in the beginning. List 4 HTML tags. I thik I would have suggested sharing the types of HTML tags gather and then reinforced that in the post."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Positive attitude. When the slides a little too quickly. So it was hard to follow along. I learned some new things."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 'CSS' - Cascading style sheets. The clothing of the structure: good sample 'Reading World Mag'. You NEED to venture out of your comfort zone!! Pick simpler topics, not related to computers!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I think I would be able to retain more if the materials were presented slower. Have paper ready for learners. Don't skip through content or say 'don't want to bore you' or say 'out of time'. I observed a very energetic and passionate presenter. Clearer explanations of instructions and steps."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Remember to target your audiences level of knowledge. Learn to offset your colors against your background. Powerpoint will be a great tool for you to use to engage your learners."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"I might slow down my pace next time. I had fun thinking about my logo! I migh also keep the slides consistent by keep on line only on each page."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - CSS - 3 Characteristics of CSS. I can tell that this is a subject that the instructor is very passionate and knowledgable. It is a lot of information presented and I would suggest the chunk and chew method to have a bit more practice for the learners to digest the new information to display to instructor. Maybe provide examples of teh characteristics that learners can relate too. It start off really well with the skeleton/HTML + the clothing/CSS"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - HTML - The preparation is evident in the magnitude of the knowledge and confidence in the knowledge. Much of the keywords was were code or in abbreviated form that made it harder to connect to the context."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Recalling yesterday's knowledge is useful. Drawing on previous learners topic is a nice touch. Your speech and tone were more natural and authentic with each lesson. I might pick a topic and start from common sense to ease into the more technical domain."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I felt confused during the presentation. There were slides skipped and the content was delivered too fast for me to keep up. I was unsure how I was to create the logo. I felt the presentation was not prepared. Pen, Paper, Slides - not organized."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Uses negative tone 'I won't bother you with that', don't. I am unsure wthat the 7 steps were. I didn't find a recieved help on my logo design."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Pick one thing that interests them. Be curious, it's about them not you. It's about them, not you. Use open-ended questions (5 - w's - who, went, where, when, why)"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - You were talking about CSS before defining it, maybe do that first. It was hard to follow along, there was a lot of information provided. Good questions for Quiz. You can tell you are passionate about the topic."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Bridge - last class, website you built. O - 3 characteristics of CSS, Pre-assessment - 0. Present - good slides with images, lots of effort. Nice to tie back to the lesson half way through. Keep an eye on time, post assessment. You love for this is clear "
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 16 min 31 secs. CSS - darkmode, hover, structural webpage, clothing for HTML. BOPPPPS, B: website, O: stated learn 4 selectors. P: asked if we know what rules based. P: what are CSS selectors - example. P: question, P: X, S: summarized. Passionate, knowledgeable about subject. Help learners learn, visuals. Like about lesson: Visuals, gave us options for resources - go to library. Quiz questions to reinforce knowledge. Motivate vs trying to make it more fun and confident. Selector: ID Selector, Class Selector, Psuedo class, CSS syntax"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - a very energetic and positive. Slow down on your slides, I didn't get that there were 7 steps. Some parameters and design with a few metrics would have [looks like 'love' not 'have', the 'h' is like an 'l', the 'a' is like an 'o'] helped [looks like 'helpe' not 'helped', the 'd' is like a sideways fish or infinity symbol with a squiggle through it to half cross it out]."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - I like how you used Analogy to explain how CSS is different from HTML. Good use of pictures for explanation. Moving a bit quickly through the slides. Maybe give the students time to process the information."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"The instructor's lesson may have been a bit advanced fro the audience. Try to find ways to  draw the learners in using props or activities. Difficult to see the key concepts"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - review with the class. Makes sure we know, what was missing."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - 'post-assessment', Objective: HTML usages. 4 HTML tags - header, doctype, 'html', '/html'. Blow up Visuals!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - #4 Pre Assessment. Asked who knew HTML. It didn't hit all learners. 0 intro self"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Lots of info! Try to streamline it for next lesson ... Keep it simple! Look more directly to your students. Hands in pockets ... try to avoid it!"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - lots of information given in slides. I like the topic and feel it would work well with more time and practice. For next presentation I would suggest a step by step approach."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Design a logo. A bit too fast going through the slides. I liked the idea of the background when getting into the topic. Enjoyed the time with share each other's design. Suggest more visuals or provide a sample of your own logos to start."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"The objective is clear which is to list 4 tags. And the practice is aligned with the goals. Walking around to check our progress might be better."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - You are clearly very passionate about the topic. But the material was too advanced and hard to understand. You could do a whole lesson on CSS background cover vs contain. How that one thing works w/ a visual. One suggestions, use a remote [clicker]. When you go up to the laptop you have a tendency to read off the screen rather than engaging with the learners. Also, consider working backwards from QUIZ + only covering material that we need. Selectors was bulk [looks like 'hulk'] of lesson, but not on the quiz"
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Have materials students need on hand/hand out ahead of lesson. I would have liked it if you  took more time w/ each of the tips/. Removes slides that aren't necessary. WOuld have like more theory + tips instead of designing one."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - CSS. I like your pace and cadence. The practical side of CSS in action was a nice piece of information to start. Still a bit of industry lingo but this time was in contetx and easier to follow along. Missed pre-assessment (unless the rules based language was, but it was not direct enough)."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Needs to get out of comfort zone. Step away from powerpoint. I did not know the extra info of Mr. Lee. Too high level, I did not understand. Read off Powerpoint. I am unsure of the purpose of a tag. Very passionate about the topic. I would have liked to see the picture overview as the main slide. Overall students were confused during discussion."
</div>

<div class="blockquote">
"Yuri - Thoughts: What is CSS? would have to to see sooner. Skipped through some slides. We try not to say 'No' when responding to students. I would try 'not quite' or 'good suggestion' to soften the response. Very clear process this time. The question I had in my head were answered a little later in your presentation. Is a selector a CSS class? I would have liked to see the 6 selectors in one slide to compare. I would have liked to read the 'why' of each selector on the power point"
</div>

<h3>Additional Notes About My Presentations</h3>

<p>Personally, I wasn't happy with any of my presentations. My confidence was at its highest in my first presentation; however, I didn't quite get to the calmness, or monotonish tones I was looking for.</p>
<p>My second presentation was in my opinion the worst. There was a natural harmony to the conversations in the classroom, a kind of symphony of sound (okay, it was more like a symphony of chatter and chirping), and I didn't feel the 'notes' I was playing harmonized as well as they could have with the others. In general, I have been disastisfied with my voice lately, which is why I have been taking voice therapy.</p>
<p>In my third presentation, I defaulted to a voice I used on the video presentations you can find on Build Hello here: <a href="https://buildhello.ca/blog/2021-11-19-what-is-above-the-fold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://buildhello.ca/blog/2021-11-19-what-is-above-the-fold/</a>. Everybody liked that voice, and gave me better reviews for that lesson. However, to be honest, that voice is a little too 'how to put on the oxygen mask on an airplane' for me, but it seems to work for teaching basic material.</p>

<p>The take away for me was that I have to continue putting my effort into working on voice development and conversational delivery. Over the last 14 years I've put most of my energy into learning computer programming, web development, data science, and economics; and I've been successful at achieving some mastery at that. However, for the most part during that time I was not developing the group skills that are critical to taking a project to the next level. Fortunately, I now have a better perspective of where I can improve, as well as some material I can use to improve with. I'm confident if I put in any where near to the kind of effort and attention I put into computer programming, it won't be long before I improve on my communication skills.</p>
