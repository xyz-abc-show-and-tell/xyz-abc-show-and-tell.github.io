<p>
Some big organizations across sectors support entire departments dedicated to digital activities. Smaller companies typically outsource production pipeline components and knowledge work. While according to <a href="https://clutch.co/bpo/virtual-assistants/resources/small-business-outsourcing-statistics">Clutch</a> nearly 25% of small businesses say they outsource, both accounting and legal services are more often procured at the small business level.<br>
</p>

<p>
In fact, what is outsourced matters. According to <a href="https://www.computereconomics.com/temp/outsourcingstatssamplepages.pdf#page=20">Computer Economics</a>, ~%60 of manufacturing, retail &amp; wholesale distribution, and financial services companies outsource app development.<br>

<p>
Arguments for outsourcing are based in economic principles of comparative advantage. Outsourcing cuts costs, contributes to gross margin, and frees resources to focus on core business function.<br>
</p>

<p>
According to Deloitte&rsquo;s <a href="http://outsourcing-outlook.com/assets/pdf/Deloitte-DOC-Whitepaper_outsourcing-and-shared-services2019-2023.pdf">Global Outsourcing Survey</a><br>
63% of respondents <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/outsourcing-stats">&rsquo;mentioned cost-cutting as a key benefit of outsourcing&rsquo;</a> and 65% said <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/outsourcing-stats">&rsquo;outsourcing helps them focus on core functions.&rsquo;</a><br>
</p>

<p>
The same specialization and comparative advantage arguments that apply to production pipelines in manufacturing and retail and distribution, apply to digital advertising and Search Engine Optimization [SEO] across sectors.<br>
</p>

<p>
This is one of the key reasons hiring a digital marketing agency for SEO services in 2022 makes sense.<br>
